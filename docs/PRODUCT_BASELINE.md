# Armosphera One Product Baseline

This project starts from the research documents in `../HAy Hashvapah Web Claude/docs/`:

- `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_RESEARCH.md`
- `ZOHO_ONE_FEATURE_MAP.md`

The active execution plan is now revised by:

- `docs/ZOHO_SALESFORCE_REWORKED_PLAN.md`
- `docs/DEEP_RESEARCH_RECONCILIATION.md`

This revision processes the attached `deep-research-report.md`. Zoho One remains the suite breadth and ergonomics benchmark, Salesforce sets the platform-depth benchmark, and Armosphera One is now scoped as a focused Armenian operating layer rather than a full clone of either product.

Commodity capabilities such as email hosting, calendaring, office documents, generic chat, full HRIS, generic website builder, RPA, and broad marketplace features are integration targets or later modules. HayHashvapah remains first-class because Armenian accounting, tax, payroll, legal RAG, e-invoice/export, and period-lock behavior are a differentiated local product advantage.

Phase 1 acceptance boundary:

- Suite login/session.
- Organization profile.
- Users, roles, and app entitlements.
- App launcher with CRM, Finance, Desk, Campaigns, Projects, Catalog & Inventory, People, Docs, Analytics, Flow.
- Audit events.
- Customer 360 spanning CRM, finance, service, automation, and legal/accounting context.
- Armenian-first demo data and localization anchors.

- Release packets link the next recurring quote handoff checksum, subsequent ongoing closeout checksum, paid subsequent payment collection checksum, official posting/draft/acceptance/release/handoff lineage, prior ongoing lineage, next recurring CRM task, quote, approval, public token, acceptance URL, AMD totals, and Armenian 20% VAT.
- Added next recurring ongoing quote release packets to tenant backup scope and `pilot.next_recurring_ongoing_renewal_quote_release.created` suite/audit events.
- Updated the workspace with a Next recurring release panel showing public quote status, total, VAT, approval id, task id, controls, and checksum evidence.
- Added API tests proving Support rejection, pre-approval blocking, public quote visibility after workflow execution, checksum verification, idempotency, auditor metadata visibility, backup inclusion, and audit evidence.

- Added API tests proving Support rejection, pre-acceptance blocking, accepted public quote handoff creation, checksum verification, idempotency, auditor metadata visibility, backup inclusion, and audit evidence.

### Slice 130 - Clinic next recurring ongoing renewal HayHashvapah draft invoice

- Added `/api/pilots/clinic-wellness/next-recurring-ongoing-renewal-hayhashvapah-drafts` list and `/api/pilots/clinic-wellness/next-recurring-ongoing-renewal-acceptance-handoffs/:handoffId/draft-invoice-packet` create endpoints with operational read access, Owner/Admin/Accountant create access, Auditor metadata visibility, and Support rejection.
- Next recurring ongoing draft packets can be created only after the owner executes the accepted quote's `finance.invoice.propose` approval and the resulting HayHashvapah draft invoice exists.
- Draft packets link the acceptance handoff checksum, public release checksum, next recurring quote handoff checksum, subsequent ongoing closeout/payment/posting/draft/acceptance/release lineage, next recurring CRM task, workflow run, finance draft invoice, AMD totals, period key, and Armenian 20% VAT mode.
- Added next recurring ongoing HayHashvapah draft packets to tenant backup scope, seeded the `2027-02` locked finance period for reopenable execution proof, and emitted `pilot.next_recurring_ongoing_renewal_hayhashvapah_draft_invoice.created` suite/audit events.
- Updated the workspace with a Next recurring draft panel showing draft number, workflow run, period, VAT mode, VAT/subtotal, task id, status, controls, and checksum-backed posting readiness.
- Added API tests proving Support rejection, pre-execution blocking, period reopen/retry handling, draft packet creation, checksum verification, idempotency, auditor metadata visibility, backup inclusion, and audit evidence.

### Slice 131 - Clinic next recurring ongoing renewal official HayHashvapah invoice posting

- Added `/api/pilots/clinic-wellness/next-recurring-ongoing-renewal-official-invoices` list and `/api/pilots/clinic-wellness/next-recurring-ongoing-renewal-hayhashvapah-drafts/:draftPacketId/posting-packet` create endpoints with operational read access, Owner/Admin/Accountant create access, Auditor metadata visibility, and Support rejection.
- Next recurring ongoing official posting packets can be created only after the HayHashvapah draft invoice is posted into an official receivable through the existing Armenian finance period-locked posting flow.
- Posting packets link the draft packet checksum, acceptance handoff checksum, public release checksum, quote handoff checksum, subsequent ongoing closeout/payment/posting/draft/acceptance/release lineage, prior ongoing lineage, next recurring CRM task, draft invoice, official invoice, finance invoice link, AMD totals, period key, and Armenian 20% VAT mode.

### Slice 132 - Clinic next recurring ongoing renewal payment collection

- Added `/api/pilots/clinic-wellness/next-recurring-ongoing-renewal-payment-collections` list and `/api/pilots/clinic-wellness/next-recurring-ongoing-renewal-official-invoices/:postingPacketId/payment-packet` create endpoints with operational read access, Owner/Admin/Accountant create access, Auditor metadata visibility, and Support rejection.
- Next recurring ongoing payment packets can be created only after the official HayHashvapah invoice is fully paid by a finance receipt.

### Slice 133 - Clinic next recurring ongoing renewal closeout

- Added `/api/pilots/clinic-wellness/next-recurring-ongoing-renewal-closeouts` list and `/api/pilots/clinic-wellness/next-recurring-ongoing-renewal-payment-collections/:paymentCollectionPacketId/closeout-packet` create endpoints with operational read access, Owner/Admin create access, Auditor metadata visibility, and Support/Accountant rejection.

- Added API tests proving Support/Accountant rejection, closeout creation, following recurring task scheduling, checksum verification, idempotency, auditor metadata visibility, Customer 360 linkage, backup inclusion, and audit evidence.

### Slice 134 - Professional Legal Source Production Review

- Added the Lawyer demo role with docs/analytics entitlement so legal reviewers can log in separately from owner/admin users.
- Source reviews now preserve reviewer role metadata and allow Owner/Admin maintenance while requiring Accountant review for the tax-code source and Lawyer review for personal-data/e-sign sources.
- The production readiness gate now treats owner/admin source maintenance as insufficient for production sign-off; it passes legal-source gates only when the latest active review comes from the matching professional role.
- The workspace review actions are shown to the relevant professional role: Accountant for VAT/tax source review and Lawyer for e-sign/personal-data source review.
- Added API tests proving professional source-review authorization, Lawyer readiness access, owner-only review not clearing the production gate, auditor write rejection, and least-privilege Lawyer entitlements.

### Slice 135 - Downstream Professional Source Enforcement

- Downstream legal/accounting actions now share the production-readiness source rule instead of checking only `legal_sources.status = active`.
- SRC export packets require Accountant-reviewed VAT/tax source signoff before packet creation, and their payload records the latest reviewer role/name.
- Docs e-sign evidence packets, personal-data requests, export packets, and retention assessments require Lawyer-reviewed source signoff before creation/execution, and their payloads preserve the professional reviewer evidence.
- Copilot citations expose `professionalReviewReady`; proposed SRC/privacy actions remain disabled after owner-only source maintenance and unlock only after matching professional review.
- Added tests proving owner-only active source maintenance still blocks SRC, e-sign, and privacy workflows while Accountant/Lawyer review unlocks them.

### Slice 136 - Copilot Advisory Audit Trail

- Each legal/accounting Copilot answer now emits a `copilot.advisory.generated` suite timeline event and audit event.
- Audit/timeline payloads intentionally store metadata only: Copilot id, intent, customer id, risk/review flags, model policy, source ids, calculation/action keys, source-review readiness, question length, and a SHA-256 question hash.
- Raw user question text and generated answer text are not stored in the audit metadata, keeping sensitive advisory prompts out of durable logs while preserving traceability.
- The Copilot API returns the fresh event list, and the React workspace refreshes the Event bus and Audit panels after a Copilot ask without discarding the visible answer.
- Added tests proving Copilot remains non-mutating while advisory use is traceable through customer timeline and audit records.

### Slice 137 - Copilot Citation Review Evidence

- Copilot source citations now render professional-review evidence in the Armenian UI instead of showing only source title/status/date.
- Ready citations show the matching professional reviewer role/name and latest review timestamp; blocked citations show that professional review is still open and identify the latest non-professional reviewer when present.
- Added tests proving owner-only VAT source maintenance is exposed as not professionally ready, while Accountant review marks the citation ready with reviewer metadata.

### Slice 138 - Copilot Citation Source Links

- Copilot source citations now render a safe external link to the maintained Armenian legal/accounting source URL with a visible host label.
- The UI only renders HTTP(S) source links and keeps them behind an explicit user click, preserving the local/offline default while making cited authority inspectable.
- Added tests proving VAT Copilot citations carry the seeded ARLIS source URL/effective date, preserve the reviewed source URL through owner-maintained and Accountant-reviewed source updates, and reject non-HTTP(S) links in the UI helper.

### Slice 139 - Legal Source Host Stability

- Legal source reviews now keep each maintained Armenian legal/accounting source on its existing source host while still allowing path, query, and version updates.
- Host comparison normalizes case and a leading `www.`, so ARLIS review updates can use either `www.arlis.am` or `arlis.am`, while arbitrary host changes are rejected before updating `legal_sources` or adding review history.
- Added API tests proving reviewed source URLs flow into legal answer citations, same-host updates are accepted, cross-host updates are rejected, and rejected reviews do not advance the stored URL or review count.

### Slice 140 - Legal Source Host Block Audit

- Blocked legal-source host changes now leave a metadata-only governance trail instead of failing silently.
- When a reviewer attempts to move a maintained Armenian legal/accounting source to a different host, the API emits matching `legal.source.review.blocked` suite and audit events before returning `400`.
- The event payload records only the source id, normalized existing host, normalized attempted host, reason, requested status/date, and reviewer role. It deliberately avoids storing the raw rejected URL in durable audit metadata.
- Added API tests proving the blocked attempt is visible in timeline/audit evidence while `legal_sources` and `legal_source_reviews` remain unchanged.

### Slice 141 - Legal Source HTTPS Downgrade Guard

- Maintained Armenian legal/accounting sources that already use HTTPS can no longer be reviewed into HTTP URLs, even when the normalized host stays the same.
- HTTPS downgrade attempts reuse the `legal.source.review.blocked` suite/audit event with `reason: "scheme-downgrade"` and store only source id, normalized hosts, and protocols.
- Downgrade audit payloads deliberately omit the raw rejected URL, title, review note, requested status/date, and reviewer role, keeping rejected review content out of durable evidence.
- Added API tests proving HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrade attempts return `400`, leave `legal_sources` and `legal_source_reviews` unchanged, and keep normal same-host HTTPS review updates working.

### Slice 142 - Legal Source Credentialed URL Guard

- Legal source review URLs that contain username/password userinfo are rejected before mutating `legal_sources` or adding review history, even when the host and HTTPS scheme are otherwise valid.
- Credentialed URL blocks reuse the `legal.source.review.blocked` suite/audit event with `reason: "url-credentials"` and store only source id, normalized hosts, and protocols.
- Credentialed URL audit payloads deliberately omit the raw rejected URL, username/password, title, review note, requested status/date, and reviewer role, keeping secrets and rejected review content out of durable evidence.
- Copilot source links refuse credentialed legacy source URLs, so citations with embedded credentials are never rendered as clickable external links.
- Added API and source-link helper tests proving credentialed review attempts return `400`, leave source state unchanged, avoid secret leakage in suite/audit payloads, and hide credentialed citation links.

### Slice 143 - Audit Reader Gate and Legal Review Note Metadata

- The global `/api/audit` feed is now an explicit audit-reader surface limited to Owner/Admin/Auditor roles; unauthenticated users still receive `401`, while Support, Accountant, and Service Manager users receive `403`.
- The React workspace skips the global audit fetch for non-audit-reader roles, preserving their app workflow access without leaking organization-wide audit details.
- Accepted legal source reviews still preserve the full reviewer note in the canonical `legal_source_reviews` record, but `legal.source.reviewed` suite/audit metadata now stores only `reviewNoteHash` and `reviewNoteLength`.
- Added API and frontend helper tests proving audit feed role gating, accepted legal-source review note non-leakage, Salesperson and Service Manager workflow compatibility, Owner/Admin/Auditor audit-reader access, and non-audit-reader UI audit-fetch suppression.

### Slice 144 - A1 Platform Tenant Resolution Bridge

- Added optional A1 Platform tenant resolution for Studio requests, controlled by `A1_PLATFORM_TENANT_RESOLUTION` and resolved from `product=studio` plus the original request host forwarded as `x-a1-request-host`.
- `/api/health` now exposes only public enabled/resolved/strict tenant flags, while `/api/platform/tenant` is limited to audit-reader roles and returns a redacted tenant summary without database URLs or raw module objects.
- Tenant resolution fails open by default for temporary platform lookup failures, fails closed when `A1_PLATFORM_TENANT_STRICT=1`, respects the existing outbound egress allowlist, caches successful per-host lookups, and always blocks tenant maintenance, tenant disabled, or module disabled platform responses.
- Platform-provided error messages are sanitized before returning to clients, and resolved tenant org ids are checked against authenticated sessions when Platform supplies an org mapping.
- Added tests proving opt-in behavior, real-fetch `x-a1-request-host` propagation to A1 Platform, token propagation, database URL and module-secret redaction, public health redaction, non-strict fail-open behavior, strict fail-closed behavior, egress blocking, disabled tenant/module blocking, sanitized strict errors, per-host cache behavior, and cross-host session replay rejection.

### Slice 145 - Tenant-Bound Public Forms and Quotes

- Public form pages and submissions now honor the resolved A1 Platform tenant org when tenant resolution is enabled.
- Public quote read and acceptance endpoints now scope token lookup by the resolved tenant org instead of relying on token-only lookup under a routed host.
- Tenant/resource mismatches return `404` so public callers cannot distinguish missing resources from resources that belong to another tenant.
- Single-tenant/local behavior is unchanged when Platform tenant resolution is disabled or a non-blocking lookup fails open.
- Added Platform-enabled tests proving wrong-host and unmapped-host form pages/submissions and quote reads/accepts are hidden with generic missing-resource responses, and that blocked form submissions and quote acceptances do not mutate the owning tenant.

### Slice 146 - Authenticated Unmapped Tenant Fail-Closed

- Authenticated Studio routes now reject a resolved A1 Platform tenant that lacks a local org mapping, even outside strict mode, using `403 A1_PLATFORM_TENANT_ORG_UNMAPPED`.
- Non-strict `tenant:null` lookup behavior still fails open for local/single-tenant continuity, matching the existing Platform bridge policy.
- Public form and quote tenant scoping remains separate and continues to hide wrong-host or unmapped-host anonymous resources with generic missing-resource responses.
- Added Platform-enabled tests covering `tenant:null` fail-open and resolved-unmapped tenant rejection on `/api/me`, `/api/suite`, and `/api/platform/tenant`.

### Slice 147 - Unmapped Tenant Login Fail-Closed

- Password login now applies the resolved-tenant org mapping guard after credential verification and before MFA challenge or session creation.
- MFA login verification now runs the same tenant guard after a valid challenge/user is known but before marking the challenge verified, updating the factor, creating a session, or setting a cookie.
- Non-strict `tenant:null` lookup behavior, invalid-credential handling, auth rate limits, disabled/module tenant blocking, and generic public-resource 404 behavior remain unchanged.
- Added Platform-enabled tests proving resolved-unmapped tenants block password login without cookies/sessions, block MFA session issuance without mutating the challenge, and still reject mapped-host session replay on authenticated routes.

### Slice 148 - Platform Auth Failure Fail-Closed

- A1 Platform auth/config failures now remain blocking even when `A1_PLATFORM_TENANT_STRICT` is off, so a bad Platform token cannot silently disable tenant enforcement.
- Temporary lookup failures, generic Platform unavailability, and non-strict `tenant:null` responses still preserve the local-first fail-open path.
- Sanitized client messages now distinguish tenant availability blocks from Platform lookup/auth failures without leaking raw Platform messages, tokens, database URLs, or secrets.
- Added Platform-enabled tests proving non-strict `PLATFORM_AUTH_FAILED` returns sanitized `401`, blocks password login, emits no cookie, and creates no local session.

### Slice 149 - Platform Tenant Auth-Cache Hardening

- A1 Platform `401`/`403` responses now default to `PLATFORM_AUTH_FAILED` even when the response body is missing, malformed, not an object, or carries an unrecognized gateway auth code, preserving fail-closed tenant enforcement outside strict mode.
- Tenant cache keys now include strict-mode state and a short SHA-256 fingerprint of the Platform token, so token rotation or strict-mode changes cannot reuse stale cached tenant/null decisions.
- Raw Platform messages remain sanitized before reaching clients, and token/database/secrets are not exposed in auth failure responses.
- Temporary Platform outages and non-strict `tenant:null` responses still preserve the local-first fail-open path.
- Added Platform-enabled tests proving auth statuses block health/login without cookies or sessions, unrecognized coded auth responses stay sanitized, token changes bypass stale cached tenant decisions, and strict-mode changes bypass stale cached null decisions.

### Slice 150 - Platform Public Resource Lookup-Failure Guard

- Non-strict temporary A1 Platform tenant lookup failures now keep `/api/health` and authenticated local continuity fail-open, but tenant-bound anonymous public resources no longer fall back to unscoped lookup.
- Public form pages/submissions and public quote read/accept endpoints treat lookup failure as an unmapped public-resource tenant and return the same generic `404` shape used for missing or wrong-tenant resources.
- Blocked public form submissions do not create CRM leads, and blocked public quote acceptance leaves the quote in `sent` state.
- Existing opt-in behavior, strict fail-closed behavior, non-strict `tenant:null` authenticated continuity, and wrong-host/unmapped-host generic 404 behavior remain unchanged.
- Added Platform-enabled tests proving health continuity plus generic public-resource 404s and no mutation under temporary Platform lookup failure.

### Slice 151 - Public Evidence Attribution Guard

- Anonymous public form submissions no longer synthesize the human Owner as the creator/actor for generated CRM leads.
- Public form-created CRM leads keep `created_by_user_id` null, `crm.lead.created` suite events keep `actor_user_id` null, and `crm.lead.created` / `forms.submission.received` audit rows keep `user_id` null while preserving org-scoped evidence and CRM routing.
- Public quote acceptance evidence now stores the direct request socket IP; forwarded proxy headers are only a fallback when no direct IP is available, so attacker-controlled `x-forwarded-for` cannot override local evidence.
- Added focused tests proving anonymous public form attribution across lead, audit, and timeline evidence, plus direct-IP storage for unauthenticated quote acceptance.

### Slice 152 - Public Form and Session Edge Guard

- Anonymous public form-page lookups (`GET /f/:id`) are now per-IP rate limited before DB lookup/rendering, so form-id enumeration receives `429` while a fresh IP can still load a published form.
- The public form-page lookup throttle is enforced even when tunnel/reverse-proxy traffic reaches Fastify as loopback, while existing local-operator loopback exemptions remain in place for auth/setup and public quote acceptance flows.
- Bearer-authenticated `/api/logout` now revokes the bearer token, matching cookie-session logout semantics.
- `getUserBySession` carries `mfa_verified`, and privileged Owner/Admin sessions created before MFA activation are rejected once an active MFA factor exists unless the session was completed through MFA.
- Added focused tests for public form-page enumeration throttling, loopback/tunnel form-page throttling, stale pre-MFA privileged session rejection, bearer logout revocation, plus public quote regression coverage to keep unrelated quote acceptances from sharing one loopback bucket.

### Slice 153 - Trusted Proxy Public Client Guard

- Added explicit opt-in public client IP resolution for tunnel/reverse-proxy deployments through `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_PUBLIC_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` plus `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_PUBLIC_CLIENT_IP_HEADER`.
- Forwarded headers are ignored by default and only honored when the direct peer is configured as trusted; supported headers are `cf-connecting-ip`, `x-real-ip`, and sanitized single-value `x-forwarded-for`.
- Multi-value or malformed `x-forwarded-for` falls back to the direct trusted proxy IP but uses a non-exempt proxy rate-limit bucket, so spoofed left-most values cannot bypass login/public throttles.
- Auth login/MFA, public form page/submit, and public quote read/accept limits use the trusted public client identity; public form submissions and quote acceptance evidence store the resolved evidence IP only when trust is explicitly configured.
- Added parser, auth, public form, and public quote regression tests covering untrusted spoofed headers, trusted loopback proxy clients, malformed XFF, and evidence behavior.

### Slice 154 - Public Loopback API Throttle Guard

- Public form submissions and public quote read/accept endpoints now use the non-loopback-exempt public limiter, matching the already-hardened `/f/:id` rendered form page.
- Loopback traffic remains exempt for local operator login/setup flows, but anonymous public API traffic that arrives through a tunnel or reverse proxy as `127.0.0.1` now receives bounded bursts followed by `429`.
- Document signing consent evidence now uses the same explicit trusted-proxy public client identity resolver as public quote and form evidence, while untrusted forwarded headers remain ignored.
- Long clinic workflow tests now simulate separate public quote buyers with distinct public IPs instead of relying on one shared loopback client, keeping production throttling strict without making fixtures brittle.
- Added regression tests for loopback public form-submit spam, loopback public quote token enumeration, loopback public quote accept attempts, and trusted/untrusted document signature evidence.

### Slice 155 - Platform Tenant-Null Public Resource Guard

- Successful A1 Platform `tenant:null` responses now keep authenticated Studio continuity fail-open outside strict mode, but no longer let anonymous tenant-bound public resources fall back to unscoped local lookup.
- Public form pages/submissions and public quote read/accept endpoints treat `tenant:null` as an unmapped public-resource tenant and return the same generic `404` shape used for missing, wrong-host, unmapped-host, and lookup-failure resources.
- Blocked public form submissions do not create CRM leads, and blocked public quote acceptance leaves the quote in `sent` state.
- Existing local/single-tenant behavior remains unchanged when Platform tenant resolution is disabled, and authenticated `/api/me` still works for non-strict `tenant:null` continuity.
- Added Platform-enabled tests proving health continuity plus generic public-resource `404`s and no mutation under successful `tenant:null` lookup.

### Slice 156 - Webhook Credentialed URL Guard

- Outbound webhook endpoint URLs containing username/password userinfo are now rejected before mutation, preventing credentialed targets from being persisted, listed, delivered to, or included in backup/restore context.
- Rejection uses the existing invalid-URL path and keeps the full credentialed URL and password out of the response body.
- Added a regression test proving the rejected URL is absent from the webhook endpoint list and database table after the failed create attempt.

### Slice 157 - Evidence Packet Reader Guard

- Signature evidence packets, privacy export packets, privacy retention assessments, and finance SRC exports now support formatter-level `includePayload` controls for broad list/suite reads.
- Full signature/privacy evidence payloads, checksums, and source keys are visible only to Owner/Admin/Lawyer/Auditor roles; full finance SRC evidence is visible only to Owner/Admin/Accountant/Auditor roles.
- Unsupported authenticated roles still receive stable packet summaries, but `payload`, `checksum`, and `sourceKey` are nulled so broad `/api/suite`, `/api/docs/signature-packets`, `/api/privacy/requests`, and `/api/finance/src-exports` reads do not leak customer tax IDs, signer evidence, source keys, or packet internals.
- Added route-level regression coverage with seeded sentinel evidence proving Support receives redacted summaries while Lawyer/Accountant users retain their permitted packet payload access.

### Slice 158 - Event Feed Payload Reader Guard

- Suite timeline reads now support role-aware payload inclusion through `eventFeedOptions(user)`.
- `/api/events`, event-returning mutation responses, and `/api/suite` redact sensitive event payload keys for non-audit roles while preserving stable operational identifiers such as quote numbers.
- Owner/Admin/Auditor still receive full timeline payload evidence for review and audit workflows.
- Unoptioned internal event-feed reads now default to redacted payloads, so forgotten call-site options fail closed instead of exposing raw timeline payloads.
- Added regression coverage proving Support cannot read quote acceptance signer email/name/total from customer event feeds, `/api/suite`, or a service-case mutation response, while Owner retains the full payload on explicitly full-access event reads.
- Customer 360 intentionally fetches full timeline payloads before applying its own role policy, preserving Owner/Admin full-customer360 evidence while Support still receives redacted timeline payloads.

### Slice 159 - Forms Submission Detail Reader Guard

- Authenticated Forms list/detail routes now use a dedicated `requireFormsReader` gate instead of plain authentication.
- Campaign-enabled roles and existing forms-writer roles, including Service Manager, can read form definitions and submissions; the read-only Auditor keeps explicit review access; Support is blocked from private intake submissions because Support lacks Campaigns access.
- Public published-form submission remains unauthenticated, rate-limited, key-whitelisted, and unchanged.
- Added regression coverage proving Support receives `403` and no submitted email/message content, while Salesperson, Service Manager, and Auditor can still read the submitted form detail.

### Slice 160 - Integration Connector Credential Guard

- Integration connector configuration now rejects endpoint URLs containing username/password userinfo before the connector row is inserted or updated.
- Endpoint URLs are validated on the raw trimmed value before the persisted 260-character limit is applied, so long credentialed URLs cannot hide userinfo past truncation.
- The rejection path uses a sanitized `400` response that does not echo the full credentialed URL or password material.
- Failed connector configuration leaves list responses, secret fingerprints, and persisted connector rows unchanged, so credentialed endpoints cannot leak through connector inventory or backup-scoped connector data.
- Legacy unsafe endpoint values already present in storage are hidden from connector list and health-check responses; the health check reports a missing endpoint instead of echoing stored credentials or truncated credential fragments.
- Added regression coverage for WhatsApp Business configuration proving raw and long credentialed URLs plus submitted secret fingerprints are absent after rejection, and legacy stored unsafe endpoint URLs are not surfaced by list or health-check APIs.

### Slice 161 - Copilot Launcher Route

- The Legal & Accounting Copilot is now a first-class launcher app, seeded with priority 3 between CRM/Finance and the remaining Suite modules.
- Existing local databases receive the Copilot app and least-privilege role assignments on reopen without requiring a fresh seed.
- Workspace app selection now follows `/app/<id>` routes, pushes history when a user opens another app, and respects browser back/forward navigation.
- App panels expose stable in-page anchors for launcher navigation; `/app/copilot` renders the Copilot panel as the active workspace.
- Added regression coverage for fresh and existing database app entitlements, plus rendered Playwright proof for Copilot to Finance route switching and back navigation.

### Slice 162 - Copilot App Access Gate

- `POST /api/copilot/questions` now requires the caller's role to have the `copilot` app assignment before intent-specific gates run.
- Finance-enabled roles without Copilot access can no longer call VAT/month-close advisory flows just because they still have Finance access.
- The React Copilot panel is no longer rendered for roles without the Copilot app assignment.
- Copilot intent tabs are filtered by the user's assigned intent apps, so UI choices match the same app-access model enforced by the API.
- Added regression coverage proving an Accountant with Finance enabled but Copilot disabled receives `403`, plus rendered proof that Support cannot see the Copilot panel at `/app/copilot`.

### Slice 163 - Dashboard Launcher Role Contract

- Seeded role app assignments now have a source-wiring regression that derives seeded login users from the fixture database, fetches each role's `/api/suite` launcher list, and checks every exposed app has the expected `/app/<id>` route.
- The same regression compares assigned app ids against `SUITE_APP_IDS` and the `suite-app-<id>` workspace anchor contract in `web/src/main.jsx`, preventing future app-assignment drift from creating a left-sidebar product with no landing target.
- Rendered Playwright proof on a fresh local preview confirmed every exposed sidebar product opens and scrolls into view for Owner, Operator, Support, Accountant, Lawyer, Salesperson, Service Manager, and Auditor.
- Suite route helpers normalize legacy product aliases before route fallback, so `/app/hayhashvapah` opens canonical HayHashvapah Finance and `/app/forms` opens the Campaigns & Forms surface.
- Malformed percent-encoded `/app/<id>` path segments now fall back to CRM instead of throwing during route selection, keeping bad local links from blanking the workspace.
- Stale invalid assigned app ids cannot become selected dashboard routes; the route helper falls back to the first canonical assigned product or CRM instead of echoing unknown assignment rows back into navigation state.
- Route app ids are trimmed and lowercased before alias and allow-list matching, so copied links like `/app/Finance` and encoded `/app/%20copilot%20` open the intended product.
- Route generation now emits canonical `/app/<id>` paths for aliases, whitespace/case drift, and unknown ids, preventing future callers from writing malformed route segments into browser history.
- Sidebar launcher buttons expose stable `data-app-id` and `data-target-app-id` metadata, and a Playwright-backed seeded-role matrix verifies every assigned product button opens its canonical route and matching workspace panel.
- Latest verification for the checkpoint: focused dashboard sidebar openability test = 1 pass; focused route helper test = 9 pass; focused dashboard source-wiring test = 1 pass; `npm test` = 424 pass.

### Slice 164 - App Assignment Role Guard

- Owner app-assignment writes now accept only roles represented by current org users plus the explicit system `Admin` role, so arbitrary submitted roles cannot create new entitlement authorities.
- Existing invalid `app_assignments` rows no longer authorize themselves through the assignment endpoint and no longer appear in live app-assignment inventory as valid role assignments.
- Access-review packets still expose enabled stale assignment rows through `invalidAssignmentRoles` and the `invalid-app-assignment-roles-detected` finding, preserving auditor visibility without granting runtime access.
- Added regression coverage with an enabled legacy `Ghost Role` assignment proving the write is rejected, no assignment audit event is created, valid role/app-matrix/orphaned-role evidence stays clean, and stale evidence is explicitly reported.

- Submitted webhook delivery IDs must be structurally safe before they can become retry attempts, delivery status changes, response evidence, outbound HTTP calls, or retry audit evidence.
- Webhook delivery path IDs must be lowercase alphanumeric/hyphen strings; unsafe route-reachable characters are rejected with `400`, and encoded or overlong route segments fail before retry side effects through either the route guard or router rejection.
- Safe unknown webhook delivery IDs still preserve existing `404` behavior, and valid failed deliveries continue through the governed manual retry flow.
- Rejected malformed webhook retry requests keep submitted path/body secrets out of error bodies, preserve the failed delivery's original status and attempt count, and leave valid endpoint creation, webhook delivery, quote acceptance, invoice-paid, connector, backup, app-assignment, and dashboard behavior unchanged.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/app.js && node --check test/api.test.js` pass; focused webhook retry regression pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "failed webhook delivery can be retried manually|invoice paid webhook is delivered only for first payment receipt|quote acceptance delivers signed quote and deal webhooks|webhook endpoint rejects credentialed URLs|webhook endpoint preserves explicit disabled toggle|webhook endpoint rejects non-boolean enabled values|webhook endpoint rejects malformed text and event values" test/api.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader connector/webhook/admin route suite pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "integration connector|webhook endpoint|webhook delivery|tenant backup|audit export|access review|app assignment|dashboard launcher|suite route|quote acceptance delivers" test/api.test.js test/suite-routes.test.mjs test/suite-dashboard-sidebar-openability.test.mjs`, 34 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only subagent review unavailable because the agent thread limit was reached; local line-numbered diff review found no issues; `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (514 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-webhook-delivery-route-id-guard-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 340 - Forms Definition Route ID Guard
- Forms definition detail and patch routes now normalize form path IDs once at the route boundary before form lookup, submission reads, or definition update work.
- Submitted form IDs must be structurally safe before they can become submission-detail reads, definition updates, public form submissions, CRM lead evidence, suite events, or audit evidence.
- Forms definition path IDs must be lowercase alphanumeric/hyphen strings; unsafe route-reachable characters are rejected with `400`, and encoded or overlong route segments fail before form side effects through either the route guard or router rejection.
- Safe unknown form IDs still preserve existing `404` behavior, and valid Forms definition, submission, public-page, and public-submit workflows continue unchanged.
- Rejected malformed Forms route requests keep submitted path/body secrets out of error bodies, preserve no-side-effect behavior across encoded and decoded malformed IDs, and leave valid form definition updates, public form pages, public submissions, CRM lead creation, service open endpoints, and public-route behavior unchanged.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/app.js && node --check test/forms.test.js && node --check test/forms-public-page.test.js` pass; focused Forms route regression pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "forms: rejects malformed metadata|forms: definition CRUD|forms isolation|forms-public-page: draft|forms-public-page: a published form renders|forms-public-page: writer-authored" test/forms.test.js test/forms-public-page.test.js`, 5 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader Forms/public-route suite pass (`node --test test/forms.test.js test/forms-public-page.test.js test/service-cases.test.js test/open-endpoints.test.js`, 18 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only subagent review unavailable because the agent thread limit was reached; local line-numbered diff review found no issues; `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (520 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-forms-route-id-guard-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 341 - Service Case Route ID Guard
- Service Desk reply, escalation, resolution, and patch routes now normalize case path IDs once at the route boundary before case lookup or mutation work.
- Submitted service case IDs must be structurally safe before they can become support replies, escalation rows, resolution rows, case updates, suite events, audit evidence, or Customer 360 timeline evidence.
- Service case path IDs must be lowercase alphanumeric/hyphen strings; unsafe route-reachable characters are rejected with `400`, and encoded or overlong route segments fail before service side effects through either the route guard or router rejection.
- Safe unknown service case IDs still preserve existing `404` behavior, and valid Service Desk console, create, reply, escalation, resolution, patch, People-HR, payroll, and tax workflows continue unchanged.
- Rejected malformed Service Desk route requests keep submitted path/body secrets out of error bodies, preserve no-side-effect behavior across encoded and decoded malformed IDs, and leave valid service case metadata, support messages, escalation/resolution evidence, suite events, audit events, People-HR payroll, and tax behavior unchanged.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/app.js && node --check test/api.test.js && node --check test/service-cases.test.js` pass; focused service route regression pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "service case mutations reject malformed metadata|service console exposes customers|PATCH cannot de-escalate|service-cases isolation" test/api.test.js test/service-cases.test.js`, 3 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader service/API/People/payroll suite pass (`node --test test/api.test.js test/service-cases.test.js test/people-hr.test.js test/payroll-endpoints.test.js test/payroll-employee-fk.test.js test/payroll.test.js test/tax-rate-versioning.test.js`, 248 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only subagent review unavailable because the agent thread limit was reached; local line-numbered diff review found no issues; `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (526 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-service-route-id-guard-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 342 - Sovereign Legal KB Build and Embedding Pipeline
- The Armenian legal RAG now has a local `buildLawsDb` pipeline that converts raw `.txt` and `.md` law sources into installable `law_chunks` SQLite rows.
- Legal text is chunked by Armenian or Latin article markers, keeping preambles and article bodies separate so Copilot grounding can cite specific articles such as VAT Article 63.
- Chunk IDs are content-addressed and idempotent, allowing repeated ingestion of the same law source without duplicate rows while preserving the `server/rag.js` schema contract.
- `scripts/ingest-laws.js` reads a law-source directory offline, derives law titles from filenames, writes the destination `laws.sqlite`, and leaves embeddings empty for sovereign BM25 retrieval by default.
- `scripts/ingest-laws.js --embed` runs the optional local embedding pass through the loopback-safe embedder, fills only NULL embedding rows, and keeps the KB usable if some or all embedding attempts fail.
- `server/lawEmbedIngest.js` serializes Float32 vectors into the BLOB shape already consumed by `server/rag.js`, skips already-embedded rows on rerun, and leaves failed rows NULL so hybrid search can fall back to BM25.
- The source separator used for content hashing is stored as escaped `\\0` text in `server/lawIngest.js`, avoiding literal NUL bytes in the JavaScript source while preserving the hash input semantics.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/lawIngest.js && node --check server/lawEmbedIngest.js && node --check server/rag.js && node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js && node --check test/law-ingest.test.js && node --check test/law-ingest-build.test.js && node --check test/law-embed.test.js && node --check test/rag.test.js` pass; focused legal/RAG ingest + embedding suite pass (`node --test test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 24 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only subagent review unavailable because the agent thread limit was reached; local diff review found the imported source file had literal NUL separators, now normalized to escaped `\\0` separators; full `npm test` pass (536 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-law-ingest-build-regression-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 343 - Workflow Finance Route ID Guard
- Workflow-run retry, draft-invoice posting, bank-transaction reconciliation, and invoice payment routes now normalize path IDs once at the route boundary before lookup or mutation work.
- Submitted workflow and finance path IDs must be structurally safe before they can become retry attempts, invoice postings, bank reconciliations, payment receipts, ledger entries, suite events, audit evidence, or Customer 360 timeline evidence.
- Workflow run, draft invoice, invoice, and bank transaction path IDs must be lowercase alphanumeric/hyphen strings; unsafe route-reachable characters are rejected with `400`, and safe unknown IDs still preserve existing `404` behavior.
- Rejected malformed workflow/finance route requests keep submitted path/body secrets out of error bodies, preserve no-side-effect behavior, and leave valid workflow retry, draft invoice posting, bank transaction reconciliation, payment receipt, ledger, event, audit, and period-lock behavior unchanged.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/app.js && node --check test/api.test.js` pass; focused workflow/finance path regression pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "workflow approval decision rejects malformed metadata|closed finance period records failed workflow run and retries|draft invoice posting rejects malformed metadata|payment receipt rejects malformed metadata|bank transaction import rejects malformed metadata" test/api.test.js`, 5 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader workflow/finance regression pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "workflow|draft invoice posting rejects|payment receipt rejects|bank transaction import rejects|finance period guardrails|closed finance period|SRC export|Armenian bank transaction import reconciles|posted HayHashvapah draft invoice creates|payment receipt marks" test/api.test.js`, 40 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only subagent review unavailable because the agent thread limit was reached; local diff review found no issues; `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (536 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-workflow-finance-route-id-guard-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 344 - Workflow Approval Route ID Guard
- Workflow approval decision and execution routes now normalize approval path IDs at the route boundary before decision-body parsing, approval lookup, execution, suite-event, or audit work.
- Submitted workflow approval IDs must be structurally safe before they can approve or execute governed workflow actions.
- Workflow approval path IDs must be lowercase alphanumeric/hyphen strings; unsafe route-reachable characters are rejected with `400`, and safe unknown IDs still preserve existing `404` behavior.
- Rejected malformed approval routes keep submitted path/body secrets out of error bodies, preserve no-side-effect behavior, and leave valid approval decisions, workflow execution, audit, and Customer 360 timeline behavior unchanged.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/app.js && node --check test/api.test.js` pass; focused workflow approval route regression pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "workflow approval decision rejects malformed metadata" test/api.test.js`, 1 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader workflow/API regression pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "workflow approval decision rejects malformed metadata|owner approval decision updates workflow queue|approved service reply workflow sends|approved overdue-invoice workflow executes|closed finance period records failed workflow run and retries|workflow dry-run|workflow test-event|workflow list query filters|workflow rule state and rollback" test/api.test.js`, 11 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); full verification is covered by Slice 346.

### Slice 345 - Legal Ingest Article Marker Guard
- Legal KB ingestion now detects OCR-corrupted Armenian article headings through an offset-preserving homoglyph shadow while preserving the original stored legal text bytes.
- Genuine Latin `Article N` source splitting remains on the original text path, keeping English/Latin-marked legal sources article-aware without mutating content.
- The homoglyph pass preserves string length so article offsets map back to the original source text and chunk bodies remain byte-for-byte faithful to the ingested law source.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/lawIngest.js && node --check test/law-ingest.test.js && node --check test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js` pass; focused legal/RAG ingest suite pass (`node --test test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 28 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); full verification is covered by Slice 346.

### Slice 346 - Native Legal PDF Ingest
- Legal KB ingestion now accepts `.pdf` law sources alongside `.txt` and `.md` sources.
- PDF text extraction shells out to the local `pdftotext` binary with UTF-8, no page-break markers, stdout capture, and a bounded buffer instead of adding a heavy in-process PDF dependency.
- Missing `pdftotext` is treated as a typed unavailable state: PDFs are skipped with a warning while plain-text and Markdown law sources continue ingesting normally.
- The PDF reader is dependency-injected so the extraction, missing-binary, non-zero-exit, title derivation, and CLI skip behavior are covered without requiring a real PDF binary in tests.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/pdfText.js && node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js && node --check test/pdf-text.test.js && node --check server/lawIngest.js && node --check test/law-ingest.test.js && node --check test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js` pass; focused PDF/legal/RAG ingest suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 35 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; capped full `npm test` pass (547 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-native-pdf-ingest-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 347 - PDF Availability Probe Hardening
- `isPdftotextAvailable` now fails closed when the `pdftotext -v` probe returns any spawn error, not only `ENOENT`.
- Non-zero `pdftotext -v` probe exits are treated as unavailable, so blocked or unrunnable binaries stay on the legal PDF skip path instead of failing later during extraction.
- The PDF text regression test covers present, missing, blocked, and failed-probe availability states while preserving the existing distinction between unavailable binaries and real extraction failures.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/pdfText.js && node --check test/pdf-text.test.js && node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js` pass; focused PDF text suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; capped full `npm test` pass (547 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-pdf-availability-probe-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 348 - PDF Extractor Unavailable Skip Hardening
- Legal KB source reading now recognizes `PdftotextUnavailableError` thrown during extraction and reports the canonical `pdftotext-unavailable` skip reason.
- The CLI keeps the same install-guidance path whether `pdftotext` is unavailable during the preflight probe or becomes unavailable before a specific PDF extraction.
- The PDF text regression test covers extractor-level unavailable failures so legal PDF ingestion continues skipping affected PDFs without losing the typed unavailable signal.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js && node --check test/pdf-text.test.js && node --check server/pdfText.js` pass; focused PDF text suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js`, 8 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader legal/RAG ingest suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 36 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; capped full `npm test` pass (548 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-pdf-extractor-unavailable-skip-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 349 - PDF Extraction Spawn Unavailable Hardening
- `extractPdfText` now maps missing or blocked `pdftotext` extraction spawn errors (`ENOENT`, `EACCES`, `EPERM`) to `PdftotextUnavailableError`.
- Late binary availability or permission changes after the preflight probe stay on the same typed legal-PDF skip path and preserve CLI install guidance.
- Non-zero `pdftotext` exits remain real extraction failures, so malformed PDFs still surface parse errors instead of being misclassified as unavailable tooling.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/pdfText.js && node --check test/pdf-text.test.js && node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js` pass; focused PDF text suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js`, 9 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader legal/RAG ingest suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 37 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; capped full `npm test` pass (549 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-pdf-extraction-spawn-unavailable-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 350 - Legal Source Regular-File Guard
- Legal KB source reading now checks extension-matched entries are regular files before `.txt`/`.md` reads or `.pdf` extraction.
- Extension-named directories, such as `Archive.pdf` or `Notes.md`, are skipped with a `not-a-file` reason instead of crashing ingestion or invoking `pdftotext` on a directory.
- The source-reader regression covers mixed regular files and extension-named directories so valid law files still ingest while non-file entries are reported and ignored.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js && node --check test/pdf-text.test.js && node --check server/pdfText.js` pass; focused PDF/source-reader suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js`, 10 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader legal/RAG ingest suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 38 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; capped full `npm test` pass (550 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-law-source-regular-file-guard-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 351 - Legal Source Symlink Guard
- Legal KB source reading now checks extension-matched entries are not symlinks before `.txt`/`.md` reads or `.pdf` extraction.
- Extension-named symlinks, such as `Linked.pdf`, are skipped with a `symlink` reason instead of following linked source paths or invoking `pdftotext` on symlink targets.
- The source-reader regression covers symlinked law-source entries so valid regular law files still ingest while linked entries are reported and ignored.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js && node --check test/pdf-text.test.js && node --check server/pdfText.js` pass; focused PDF/source-reader suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js`, 11 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader legal/RAG ingest suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 39 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only subagent review unavailable because the agent thread limit was reached; local diff review found no issues; `git diff --check` pass; capped full `npm test` pass (551 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-law-source-symlink-guard-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 352 - Legal Source Hidden-File Guard
- Legal KB source reading now skips dot-prefixed extension-matched entries before `.txt`/`.md` reads or `.pdf` extraction.
- AppleDouble sidecars such as `._Tax.pdf` and hidden draft files such as `.Draft.md` are reported with a `hidden-file` skip reason instead of becoming legal KB sources.
- The source-reader regression covers hidden law-source sidecars so valid visible regular law files still ingest while hidden entries are reported and ignored.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js && node --check test/pdf-text.test.js && node --check server/pdfText.js` pass; focused PDF/source-reader suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js`, 12 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader legal/RAG ingest suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 40 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); local diff review found no issues; `git diff --check` pass; capped full `npm test` pass (552 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-law-source-hidden-file-guard-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 353 - Legal Source Text-Read Guard
- Legal KB source reading now skips unreadable `.txt` and `.md` law-source files with a `read-failed` reason instead of aborting the whole source read.
- The ingest CLI reports skipped source files generically, so text-read failures, hidden files, symlinks, non-files, and unavailable PDFs share the same source-skip reporting path.
- The source-reader regression covers a failed text read beside a valid Armenian text source so readable source files still ingest while the bad text source is reported and ignored.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check scripts/ingest-laws.js && node --check test/pdf-text.test.js && node --check server/pdfText.js` pass; focused PDF/source-reader suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js`, 13 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader legal/RAG ingest suite pass (`node --test test/pdf-text.test.js test/law-ingest.test.js test/law-ingest-homoglyph.test.js test/law-ingest-build.test.js test/law-embed.test.js test/rag.test.js test/legal-search.test.js test/legal-grounding.test.js`, 41 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); local diff review found no issues; `git diff --check` pass; capped full `npm test` pass (553 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-law-source-text-read-guard-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 354 - Catalog Product Master Spine
- The suite now has tenant-scoped `catalog_categories` and `catalog_items` tables as the first ERP catalog master-data spine after the ERP comparison plan.
- Seed data creates Armenian service-package and hardware catalog anchors for clinic retention, salon inbox setup, tourism booking workflows, and POS barcode scanners.
- Authenticated `/api/catalog/categories` and `/api/catalog/items` endpoints expose read access to operating roles while limiting catalog writes to Owner/Admin/Operator/Salesperson.
- Catalog item writes validate SKU, category, item type, status, currency, price/cost, stock tracking, lot tracking, VAT mode, fiscal receipt metadata, and route IDs before mutation or audit evidence.
- CRM quote lines can now reference active catalog items, resolving catalog description, price, SKU/name, VAT mode, and fiscal receipt requirements into stored quote-line evidence.
- Catalog-backed CRM quote totals aggregate VAT per line, preserving standard inclusive VAT behavior while keeping exempt and zero-rated catalog lines out of the VAT bucket.
- Catalog seed rows keep the existing demo IDs while deriving tenant-specific seed IDs for non-demo organizations, preventing fixed product-master IDs from colliding across tenants.
- Tenant backups now include `catalog_categories` and `catalog_items`, keeping product master data in the existing backup/restore evidence scope.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/db.js`, `node --check server/app.js`, and `node --check test/catalog.test.js` pass; focused catalog suite pass (`node --test test/catalog.test.js`, 5 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader API/catalog/public quote suite pass (`node --test test/api.test.js test/catalog.test.js test/public-quote-ratelimit.test.js`, 247 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); full `npm test` pass (579 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-kernel-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 355 - Inventory Stock Ledger Spine
- The suite now has tenant-scoped `stock_locations`, `stock_quants`, and `stock_moves` tables as the first ERP-parity inventory ledger spine after the catalog master.
- Seed data creates internal warehouse and dispatch-staging locations plus supplier, customer, inventory-adjustment, and scrap virtual endpoints for Armenian operating flows.
- Opening inventory seeds 12 POS barcode scanners into the demo main warehouse from the catalog item master, while non-demo organizations receive only the location scaffold and no fake stock moves or quants.
- Authenticated `/api/inventory/locations`, `/api/inventory/stock`, and `/api/inventory/moves` endpoints expose stock ledger reads to Owner/Admin/Operator/Accountant/Auditor while rejecting Support/Salesperson reads.
- `/api/inventory/moves` posts governed inbound, outbound, receipt, delivery, adjustment, transfer, and scrap moves for stock-tracked active catalog items, with writes limited to Owner/Admin/Operator/Accountant.
- Stock move posting validates item IDs, location IDs, move type, integer quantity/cost, safe evidence text, active locations, internal transfer rules, and source availability before transaction side effects.
- Internal-source moves derive their unit cost from source stock average cost, so transfer, delivery, and scrap valuation cannot be overwritten by caller-supplied `unitCost`; supplied cost remains available for receipt/positive adjustment valuation.
- Internal stock locations update on-hand quants; supplier, customer, inventory-adjustment, and scrap locations remain virtual ledger endpoints visible on posted move evidence without inflating internal availability.
- Posted stock moves emit `inventory.stock_move.posted` suite and audit events with metadata-only evidence, and tenant backups now include stock locations, quants, and moves with parent stock locations serialized before child locations.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/db.js`, `node --check server/app.js`, `node --check test/inventory.test.js`, and `node --check test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js` pass; focused inventory/auditor suite pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/inventory.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js`, 6 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); impacted catalog/inventory/auditor suite pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/catalog.test.js test/inventory.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js`, 11 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only re-review approved valuation, backup-order, and non-demo seed fixes; full `npm test` pass (583 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-inventory-stock-ledger-spine-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 356 - HayHashvapah E-Invoice XML Builder Engine
- The suite now has a pure local `server/einvoice.js` export helper for HayHashvapah e-invoice XML preparation.
- The builder supports multi-line invoices, buyer/supplier ՀՎՀՀ tax IDs, whole-dram AMD rounding, per-line VAT calculation, explicit VAT overrides for exempt or zero-rated lines, and XML escaping for free-text descriptions.
- The export namespace stays `urn:hayhashvapah:einvoice:1` and the output is deliberately framed as an offline mapper toward the official SRC e-invoice XSD path, not live SRC submission or certificate handling.
- `eInvoiceTotals` provides reusable integer-dram totals for net, VAT, and total amounts across invoice lines.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/einvoice.js && node --check test/einvoice.test.js` pass; focused e-invoice suite pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/einvoice.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); full `npm test` pass (583 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-inventory-stock-ledger-spine-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 357 - Armenian VAT Return Computation Engine
- The suite now has a pure local `server/vatReturn.js` computation helper for Armenian VAT-return period figures.
- `computeVatReturn` calculates output VAT, recoverable input VAT, taxable sales base, taxable purchases base, net VAT position, payable amount, and carried-forward credit.
- VAT line normalization uses whole-dram AMD rounding and supports explicit `vatAmount` overrides for exempt, zero-rated, or corrected source lines.
- Non-recoverable purchases remain in the taxable purchase base while being excluded from recoverable input VAT.
- The engine deliberately computes RA VAT figures only; mapping those figures onto official SRC VAT-return form line numbers remains a separate form-spec task.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/vatReturn.js && node --check test/vat-return.test.js` pass; focused VAT-return suite pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/vat-return.test.js`, 6 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); full `npm test` pass (583 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-inventory-stock-ledger-spine-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 358 - VAT Return API Spine
- The suite now exposes the pure Armenian VAT return engine through a posted-ledger read endpoint at `GET /api/finance/vat-return`.
- The read endpoint supports both all-period and period-filtered VAT summaries, preserving `/api/finance/vat-report` all-period semantics while returning taxable sales, taxable purchases, output VAT, input VAT, net position, payable amount, and carried credit.
- Tenant-scoped `finance_vat_returns` records now persist immutable accountant-review VAT return packets with payload checksum, period key, legal source, totals, note, source key, creator, and timestamp.
- `POST /api/finance/vat-returns` is gated to Owner/Admin/Accountant finance operators, requires an open finance period and Accountant-reviewed VAT legal source, and is idempotent by period.
- `GET /api/finance/vat-returns` uses the existing finance evidence policy: Owner/Admin/Accountant/Auditor can review full payload/checksum/source-key evidence, while unsupported authenticated roles receive redacted packet summaries.
- Prepared VAT return packets emit `finance.vat_return.created` suite/audit evidence and are included in tenant backup scope.
- The auditor read-only regression now covers VAT return packet creation, while focused VAT packet tests cover malformed metadata no-side-effect behavior, unauthorized writers, reviewed-source prerequisite, closed-period blocking, role redaction, backup inclusion, and payroll exclusion from VAT bases.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks passed for touched server/test files; focused VAT/API/auditor verification passed (`node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/finance-reports.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js`, 8 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only subagent review found and the current tree covers the omitted-period VAT-return regression; final full `TMPDIR=/tmp/a1-suite-test-tmp npm test` pass (606 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-vat-return-api-spine-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 358 - VAT Return API Spine
- The VAT return engine is now exposed through authenticated posted-ledger APIs: `GET /api/finance/vat-return` returns all-period or period-filtered Armenian VAT figures from posted ledger rows.
- Governed VAT return evidence packets now live in the tenant-scoped `finance_vat_returns` table and are included in tenant backup/restore payloads.
- `POST /api/finance/vat-returns` creates an idempotent period packet only for finance operators, only while the finance period is open, and only after the VAT legal source has Accountant professional review.
- VAT packets capture organization, period, reviewed legal source, source ledger inputs, output/input VAT, taxable sales/purchases, net, payable, carried credit, checksum, note, and accountant-review disclaimer evidence.
- `GET /api/finance/vat-returns` lists packets with the same evidence redaction contract as SRC exports: Owner/Admin/Accountant/Auditor can inspect payload/checksum/source-key, while unsupported roles receive stable redacted summaries.
- `/api/suite` now carries `vatReturns` beside `srcExports`, preserving suite-level redaction for finance evidence packets.
- Auditor read-only coverage now explicitly proves Auditors can read VAT return packets but cannot prepare them.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js`, `server/db.js`, `test/api.test.js`, `test/vat-return-api.test.js`, `test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js`, and `test/finance-reports.test.js`; focused VAT/API/auditor suite pass (`node --test test/finance-reports.test.js test/vat-return.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js`, 14 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); focused SRC/report/redaction suite pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "VAT return|SRC export|finance report query filters|evidence packet list endpoints hide payloads" test/api.test.js`, 6 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader impacted suite pass (`node --test test/api.test.js test/finance-reports.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/vat-return.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js test/accounting.test.js test/ledger.test.js test/einvoice.test.js test/vat-rate-versioning.test.js`, 271 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); after restoring the missing local Playwright Chromium cache with `npx playwright install chromium`, full `npm test` pass (606 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-vat-return-api-spine-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 359 - E-Invoice Official Field Alignment
- The HayHashvapah e-invoice XML builder now emits official SRC-facing fields for transaction type and creation date while preserving the existing local export namespace.
- Supplier evidence now includes the VAT-payer registration number (`VatId`) and address fields.
- Buyer evidence now supports passport identification when an individual buyer has no ՀՎՀՀ tax ID.
- Line evidence now carries unit price, excise amount, and environmental fee; line and document totals include excise and environmental fee alongside net and VAT.
- The export remains an offline structured mapper toward the customer's SRC desktop/XSD workflow, not live SRC submission or certificate handling.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/einvoice.js && node --check test/einvoice.test.js && node --test test/einvoice.test.js` pass (12 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); final all-merged verification is covered by Slice 361.

### Slice 360 - Official SRC VAT Return Form Lines
- `server/vatReturn.js` now exports `vatReturnForm()` beside `computeVatReturn`, preserving the existing engine contract while adding official form-line mapping.
- VAT output is mapped to lines 7, 9, 12, 13, and 16 for standard 20%, 16.67% imputed, zero-rated, exempt, and total credit evidence.
- Recoverable input VAT is split between import and domestic acquisition buckets on lines 17 and 18, then rolled into line 21.
- Net period position is mapped to line 23 as payable versus recoverable credit.
- `IMPUTED_VAT_RATE` is exposed for the 16.67% VAT-inclusive form bucket.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/vatReturn.js && node --check test/vat-return.test.js && node --check test/vat-return-api.test.js && node --test test/vat-return.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/finance-reports.test.js` pass (17 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); final all-merged verification is covered by Slice 361.

### Slice 361 - Full RA Chart of Accounts
- The Armenian localization kernel now ships a generated `server/armeniaChartOfAccounts.data.js` full official chart with 623 accounts across classes 1-9.
- Account classes now cover management-accounting and off-balance-sheet classes in addition to assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses.
- Chart helpers load the generated data module and keep type/class/normal-balance invariants testable across the full chart.
- The local double-entry ledger posting model remains unchanged; existing operational ledger accounts and finance flows continue to pass against the expanded localization chart.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/armeniaChartOfAccounts.js && node --check server/armeniaChartOfAccounts.data.js && node --check test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js && node --test test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/localization.test.js test/accounting.test.js test/ledger.test.js` pass (32 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader all-merged impacted suite pass (`node --test test/api.test.js test/finance-reports.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/vat-return.test.js test/einvoice.test.js test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/localization.test.js test/accounting.test.js test/ledger.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js test/tax-rate-versioning.test.js test/vat-rate-versioning.test.js`, 299 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); full `npm test` pass (617 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-track-b-merged-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`).

### Slice 362 - Offline RA Localization CLI
- The suite now has an offline `scripts/ra-localization.js` CLI over the Armenian fiscal-localization engines, with no server and no network requirement.
- The CLI exposes taxpayer ՀՎՀՀ validation, Armenian phone normalization, marz lookup, chart-of-accounts lookup, payroll calculation, VAT-return JSON calculation, and e-invoice XML generation.
- Structured commands emit JSON, e-invoice emits XML, and invalid CLI inputs exit non-zero with usage guidance.
- The CLI lazily loads each engine so newly landed RA localization modules can be used independently.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check scripts/ra-localization.js && node --check test/ra-localization-cli.test.js && node --test test/ra-localization-cli.test.js` pass (6 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); final all-merged verification is covered by Slice 365.

### Slice 363 - Official RA Chart Ledger And UI Integration
- The active HayHashvapah ledger now seeds and refreshes tenant `ledger_accounts` from the generated 623-account official RA chart instead of the old 11-account subset.
- New expense and supplier-bill input VAT postings now debit official account `226` (`Հաշվանցման (փոխհատուցման) ենթակա անուղղակի հարկեր`) while VAT reports and VAT-return source extraction still read legacy local `526` rows for older databases.
- Authenticated `GET /api/finance/chart-of-accounts` exposes the official chart source metadata, account classes, and account rows to the Finance workspace.
- The Finance UI now renders an RA chart-of-accounts panel with class counts, official source metadata, and operating account anchors, and the opening-balance form derives its choices from the supported official operating accounts (`221/226/251/252/521/524/525`) instead of offering every official asset/liability account.
- Regression coverage proves full official chart seeding, `226` VAT posting, legacy `526` read compatibility, chart endpoint auth/shape, VAT-return packet extraction, and opening-balance compatibility, including rejection/skipping for unsupported contra-asset accounts such as `112`.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/ledger.js`, `server/app.js`, `test/ledger.test.js`, `test/ledger-endpoints.test.js`, and `test/vat-return-api.test.js`; focused official-chart ledger/API suite pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/ledger.test.js test/ledger-endpoints.test.js test/finance-reports.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/opening-balances.test.js test/opening-balances-endpoints.test.js`, 39 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); later focused all-merged RA finance/localization/payroll suite pass (`node --test test/ra-localization-cli.test.js test/armenia-payroll.test.js test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/localization.test.js test/ledger.test.js test/ledger-endpoints.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/finance-reports.test.js`, 52 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); final opening-balance whitelist verification is covered by Slice 365.

### Slice 364 - Armenian Payroll Rules Engine
- The suite now ships `server/armeniaPayroll.js`, a pure local Armenian payroll calculation engine for 2026 gross-to-net previews.
- The engine applies flat 20% personal income tax, funded-pension tiers (`5%` below the threshold, `10% - 25,000` above it, capped at `87,500`), and the post-December-2025 stamp-duty brackets.
- Payroll deductions are calculated from gross and rounded to whole dram through the existing accounting kernel.
- The new Dec-2025 health-insurance contribution remains intentionally excluded until the offset against stamp duty is pinned to primary law.
- Regression coverage proves tax, pension, stamp-duty, tier-boundary continuity, pension cap, zero-gross behavior, and explicit health-insurance omission.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `node --check server/armeniaPayroll.js && node --check test/armenia-payroll.test.js && node --test test/armenia-payroll.test.js` pass (8 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); focused all-merged RA finance/localization/payroll suite pass (`node --test test/ra-localization-cli.test.js test/armenia-payroll.test.js test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/localization.test.js test/ledger.test.js test/ledger-endpoints.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/finance-reports.test.js`, 52 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); final all-merged verification is covered by Slice 365.

### Slice 365 - Authenticated RA Localization Routes And Opening-Balance Account Whitelist
- `server/localizationRoutes.js` now registers authenticated, stateless RA localization endpoints for the full chart of accounts, single account code lookups, ՀՎՀՀ validation, Armenian regions, phone normalization, VAT-return computation, payroll computation, and e-invoice XML building.
- The localization route module keeps the `server/app.js` footprint small and lazy-loads optional fiscal engines so route registration stays robust as engines land independently.
- The official chart endpoint now also returns `openingBalanceAccountCodes`, making the Finance UI use the backend-supported account whitelist instead of inferring from every official asset/liability account.
- Opening-balance posting is limited to supported operating accounts (`221/226/251/252/521/524/525`) until account-level contra/normal-balance semantics are added for the broader official chart.
- Backend guards reject unsupported official contra-asset codes such as `112`, and the ledger silently skips them when called at the posting layer.
- The Finance opening-balance form now renders exactly the supported official account anchors and no longer offers `112`, `331`, or arbitrary asset/liability chart rows.
- Verification for the checkpoint: localization route suite pass (`node --check server/localizationRoutes.js && node --check test/localization-routes.test.js && node --check server/app.js && node --test test/localization-routes.test.js`, 5 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); focused opening-balance/chart suite pass (`node --check server/app.js && node --check server/ledger.js && node --check test/opening-balances.test.js && node --check test/opening-balances-endpoints.test.js && node --check test/ledger-endpoints.test.js && node --test test/opening-balances.test.js test/opening-balances-endpoints.test.js test/ledger-endpoints.test.js test/ledger.test.js`, 27 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (640 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-opening-balance-whitelist-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`); browser smoke on `http://127.0.0.1:4193/app/finance` renders `RA chart of accounts`, `623 accounts`, exactly the seven supported opening-balance accounts, no `112`/`331` options, and no unexpected console errors after the expected pre-login `401`.

### Slice 366 - RA Localization Route Metadata Guard
- Authenticated RA localization routes now reject malformed query values before fiscal engines run, keeping chart-of-accounts, ՀՎՀՀ, and Armenian phone helpers limited to bounded safe text.
- VAT-return and e-invoice helper routes now require plain bounded JSON bodies without control characters, oversized strings, deep nesting, unsupported objects, or secret-bearing multiline evidence.
- Payroll preview now validates `gross` as a finite non-negative AMD amount before calling the Armenian payroll engine, returning a sanitized 400 instead of allowing object coercion or engine-level surprises.
- Route guard errors use the stable `INVALID_LOCALIZATION_METADATA` code and do not echo submitted secret tokens in HTTP error responses.
- The Finance workspace now includes an `RA localization tools` panel over the same authenticated helper routes for ՀՎՀՀ validation, Armenian phone normalization, payroll preview, and VAT form-line preview.
- Scoped responsive CSS keeps the new localization controls stable inside the existing dense finance workspace without changing unrelated inline-form layouts.
- Verification for the checkpoint: focused route guard verification pass (`node --check server/localizationRoutes.js && node --check test/localization-routes.test.js && node --test test/localization-routes.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader fiscal/localization suite pass (`node --test test/localization-routes.test.js test/localization.test.js test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/armenia-payroll.test.js test/armenia-phone.test.js test/armenia-regions.test.js test/vat-return.test.js test/einvoice.test.js test/ra-localization-cli.test.js`, 72 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (642 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-localization-route-guards-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`); browser smoke on `http://127.0.0.1:4194/app/finance` renders `RA localization tools`, exercises ՀՎՀՀ/phone/payroll/VAT buttons, captures `/tmp/a1-suite-localization-route-guards-finance.png`, and reports no unexpected console errors after the expected pre-login `401`.

### Slice 367 - Finance E-Invoice XML Preview
- The SPA request layer now has an `apiText()` helper for authenticated XML/text responses, preserving the existing JSON `api()` behavior for normal endpoints.
- The Finance `RA localization tools` panel now includes an e-invoice XML preview workflow against `/api/finance/einvoice/build`, closing the UI handoff gap documented by `docs/LOCALIZATION_API.md`.
- The preview captures invoice number, buyer ՀՎՀՀ, and line net amount, then builds a local preview invoice with transaction type, issue/creation dates, supplier evidence, buyer evidence, and a 20% VAT line.
- The panel renders the generated XML excerpt and total amount in a bounded wrapped preview area so long XML cannot overflow the dense finance workspace.
- `docs/LOCALIZATION_API.md` now states that the e-invoice build route returns XML text rather than JSON.
- Verification for the checkpoint: focused route guard verification pass (`node --check server/localizationRoutes.js && node --check test/localization-routes.test.js && node --test test/localization-routes.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader fiscal/localization suite pass (`node --test test/localization-routes.test.js test/localization.test.js test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/armenia-payroll.test.js test/armenia-phone.test.js test/armenia-regions.test.js test/vat-return.test.js test/einvoice.test.js test/ra-localization-cli.test.js`, 72 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (642 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-finance-einvoice-preview-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`); browser smoke on `http://127.0.0.1:4195/app/finance` renders `RA localization tools`, exercises ՀՎՀՀ/phone/payroll/VAT/e-invoice buttons, captures `/tmp/a1-suite-finance-einvoice-preview.png`, and reports no unexpected console errors after the expected pre-login `401`.

### Slice 368 - Finance Opening-Balance Side Rules
- Opening balances now use configured account-side rules for the supported official RA balance-sheet anchors instead of treating every whitelisted account by broad account type alone.
- The supported opening-balance set now includes depreciable fixed assets (`111`, debit) and accumulated depreciation (`112`, credit), while still excluding unsupported chart rows and direct opening-equity account `331`.
- `GET /api/finance/chart-of-accounts` now returns `openingBalanceAccounts` with `{ code, name, type, side }` metadata beside `openingBalanceAccountCodes`, so UI callers can submit the reviewed side contract explicitly.
- Opening-balance POST validation accepts omitted side defaults or matching explicit `debit`/`credit` values, rejects malformed or mismatched side evidence before persistence, and keeps rejected side payloads out of ledger rows and audit evidence.
- The ledger posts credit-side contra balances against opening equity, so `111` less `112` accumulated depreciation keeps trial balance, balance sheet, and opening equity balanced.
- The Finance opening-balance form and posted-balance list now render Armenian side labels and submit the configured side for pending lines.
- Verification for the checkpoint: focused opening-balance/ledger verification pass (`node --check server/ledger.js && node --check server/app.js && node --check test/opening-balances.test.js && node --check test/opening-balances-endpoints.test.js && node --check test/ledger-endpoints.test.js && node --test test/opening-balances.test.js test/opening-balances-endpoints.test.js test/ledger-endpoints.test.js test/ledger.test.js`, 29 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); broader finance/localization suite pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/ledger.test.js test/ledger-endpoints.test.js test/finance-reports.test.js test/vat-return-api.test.js test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/opening-balances.test.js test/opening-balances-endpoints.test.js`, 42 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); read-only code-review subagent found no issues; `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (644 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning after clearing npm cache space; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-opening-balance-side-rules-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`); browser smoke on `http://127.0.0.1:4196/app/finance` verifies `111 · Մաշվող հիմնական միջոցներ · Դեբետ`, `112 · Հիմնական միջոցների մաշվածություն · Կրեդիտ`, posts `1,000,000 AMD` in `111` less `(200,000 AMD)` accumulated depreciation, shows `800,000 AMD equity`, captures `/tmp/a1-suite-opening-balance-side-rules.png`, and reports no browser console errors.

### Slice 369 - Official Localization Source Metadata And Payroll Health Insurance
- The VAT-return engine now carries official SRC VAT/excise return source metadata (`N 298-Ն`, arlis.am, active incorporated source) alongside the computed line values.
- `vatReturnForm()` exposes reusable line definitions for lines `7`, `9`, `12`, `13`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `21`, and `23`, including Armenian labels, form sections, and expected fields.
- The authenticated VAT compute route and offline `ra-localization vat-return` CLI now return `formSource` and `formLineDefinitions` beside the existing `summary` and `form` payloads.
- The Finance `RA localization tools` panel renders official VAT form-line labels and a bounded source row linking the `N 298-Ն` source host, while preserving the existing dense Finance layout.
- The Armenian payroll localization kernel now includes the Dec-2025 universal health-insurance employee withholding: `0` below `200,001 AMD`, `4,800 AMD` through `500,000 AMD`, and `10,800 AMD` from `500,001 AMD`.
- `computePayroll()` now returns `healthInsurance` and includes it in `totalWithholdings`/`net`, so an `800,000 AMD` preview returns `10,800 AMD` health insurance, `226,800 AMD` total withholdings, and `573,200 AMD` net salary.
- `docs/LOCALIZATION_API.md` now documents the expanded payroll response contract, the official VAT form metadata payload, and the official Arlis/SRC source anchors used by the localization slice.
- Regression coverage proves payroll health-insurance boundaries, API/CLI propagation, VAT form source metadata, VAT line definitions, and rendered Finance preview output.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/armeniaPayroll.js`, `test/armenia-payroll.test.js`, and `test/localization-routes.test.js`; focused payroll/routes/CLI tests pass (`node --test test/armenia-payroll.test.js`, 8 pass; `node --test test/localization-routes.test.js`, 7 pass; `node --test test/ra-localization-cli.test.js`, 7 pass); broader fiscal/localization suite pass (`node --test test/localization-routes.test.js test/localization.test.js test/armenia-chart-of-accounts.test.js test/armenia-payroll.test.js test/armenia-phone.test.js test/armenia-regions.test.js test/vat-return.test.js test/einvoice.test.js test/ra-localization-cli.test.js`, 74 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `git diff --check` pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; first full `npm test` run reaches 646 pass / 1 environment failure because the local Playwright Chromium cache was missing, then `npx playwright install chromium` and `node --test test/suite-dashboard-sidebar-openability.test.mjs` pass; final full `npm test` pass (647 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-localization-source-payroll-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=10, kpis=4`); browser smoke on `http://127.0.0.1:4197/app/finance` verifies `health insurance 10,800 AMD`, `stamp duty 1,000 AMD`, `net salary 573,200 AMD`, source row `N 298-Ն · arlis.am`, captures `/tmp/a1-suite-localization-source-payroll.png`, and reports only the known optional-section `loadOr` fallback warning.

### Slice 370 - Catalog & Inventory Sidebar Workspace
- Catalog & Inventory is now a canonical Suite app id and route (`inventory`, `/app/inventory`) between Projects and People in the sidebar.
- Fresh seeds and existing database repair insert the Inventory launcher app, preserve priority ordering, and assign it to `Owner`, `Admin`, `Operator`, and `Accountant`.
- The Inventory workspace renders catalog/stock metrics, product master rows, internal stock balances, recent stock moves, and a role-gated stock move form.
- The stock move form now computes valid default source/destination locations for transfer, receipt, delivery, adjustment, and scrap using the same warehouse-location model as the backend.
- The app-assignment route rejects attempts to enable Inventory for roles that cannot load both catalog and inventory APIs, and stale hand-edited Inventory assignments cannot authorize sidebar access.
- Regression coverage proves seeded/repaired Inventory app ordering, role entitlements, stale assignment filtering, dashboard sidebar openability, catalog item reads, stock ledger reads, stock move posting, and unsafe inventory metadata rejection.
- Verification for the checkpoint: focused assignment regression pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "app assignment rejects inventory|owner can update app assignment|app assignment rejects malformed metadata" test/api.test.js`, 3 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); focused route/catalog/inventory/sidebar suite pass (`node --test test/suite-routes.test.mjs test/suite-dashboard-sidebar-openability.test.mjs test/catalog.test.js test/inventory.test.js`, 19 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (648 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-inventory-ui-smoke-final-2.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=11, kpis=4`); browser smoke on `http://127.0.0.1:4198/app/inventory` verifies the active Inventory sidebar route, default transfer path `WH/STOCK -> WH/OUT`, submitted Scrap path `WH/STOCK -> SCRAP`, stock row `11 available`, and no browser console warnings/errors.

### Slice 371 - Purchase RFQ/PO To Stock Receipt And Vendor Bill
- Tenant-scoped `purchase_orders` and `purchase_order_lines` now provide the first procurement spine over the shipped Catalog, Inventory, and Finance modules.
- Purchase is now a first-class Suite sidebar product at `/app/purchase`, seeded/repaired after Catalog & Inventory and assigned only to Owner/Admin/Operator/Accountant roles while preserving Auditor read-only API access.
- The Purchase workspace loads purchase orders plus stock-tracked catalog items, renders RFQ/confirmed/received/billed counts, open procurement value, order rows, and role-gated Create RFQ / Confirm / Receive / Bill controls.
- Purchase RFQs capture supplier name, optional Armenian ՀՎՀՀ, PO number, order/expected dates, notes, product-linked lines, whole-AMD subtotal/VAT/total values, creator evidence, and status progression.
- Purchase role gates allow Owner/Admin/Operator/Accountant to create/confirm/receive POs, allow Auditor read-only listing, and require finance-operator access for PO-to-bill conversion.
- PO confirmation is explicit, PO receipt creates canonical stock receipt moves into `WH/STOCK`, and received lines store the resulting stock-move evidence.
- PO billing reuses the existing HayHashvapah vendor-bill engine, so AP totals, due dates, payables reporting, finance audit, and finance-period locks stay consistent with manual supplier bills.
- Confirm/receive/bill retries are idempotent after progression, duplicate PO numbers return a sanitized `409`, malformed body/path metadata is rejected before mutation, and unsupported roles cannot write purchase evidence.
- Trigger-backed regressions prove confirm/receipt/bill failures roll back status, stock moves, ledger rows, AP bills, suite events, and audit rows instead of creating idempotency gaps.
- Tenant backups now include purchase orders, purchase lines, bills, and bill payments so procurement evidence restores with stock-move and AP-bill links.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks the core purchase spine and first Purchase sidebar workspace as shipped while keeping vendor master/pricelists, partial receipts, landed costs, tenders, and procurement analytics in the roadmap.
- Verification for the checkpoint: focused API/sidebar role pass (`node --test --test-name-pattern "owner login loads organization|existing suite databases receive repaired|expanded Armenia SaaS roles|dashboard launcher source wiring|app assignment rejects operations apps" test/api.test.js`, 5 pass, 0 fail); focused purchase/auditor pass (`node --test test/purchase.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js`, 4 pass, 0 fail); sidebar openability pass (`node --test test/suite-dashboard-sidebar-openability.test.mjs`); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-purchase-ui-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); browser proof against the local app created/confirmed/received/billed `UI-RFQ-230529`; full `npm test` pass (697 pass, 0 fail).

### Slice 372 - Purchase Vendor Master And Pricelist Defaults
- Tenant-scoped `purchase_vendors` and `purchase_vendor_prices` now provide the first vendor master and vendor-cost layer for Purchase.
- Fresh and repaired databases create vendor/pricelist tables, add `purchase_orders.vendor_id`, add `purchase_order_lines.vendor_price_id`, index vendor lookups, seed a demo Armenian vendor, and include vendor/pricelist tables in tenant backups.
- Purchase APIs expose role-gated vendor listing and vendor creation; invalid price windows, unknown catalog items, malformed metadata, and duplicate vendor names fail before durable mutation.
- RFQ creation can link to an active vendor, inherit supplier name/ՀՎՀՀ, choose the best active vendor price by item, quantity, and order date, and persist the selected vendor-price evidence on the purchase line.
- The Purchase workspace loads vendors alongside orders/catalog items, shows vendor count, lets operators select a vendor or enter a manual supplier, and leaves blank unit-cost fields to backend vendor-pricelist resolution instead of bypassing validity rules.
- Verification for the checkpoint: focused purchase/API/sidebar run pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/purchase.test.js test/api.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js test/suite-routes.test.mjs test/suite-dashboard-sidebar-openability.test.mjs`, 249 pass, 0 fail); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-purchase-vendor-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); browser proof on `/app/purchase` selected `Yerevan Hardware Supply`, inherited ՀՎՀՀ `01234568`, used the `60000` vendor-price default, and created/confirmed/received/billed `UI-VENDOR-290329` at `72,000 AMD`; `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (700 pass, 0 fail).

### Slice 373 - Purchase Partial Receipts And Receipt Evidence
- Tenant-scoped `purchase_receipts` now preserves each purchase receipt's PO, PO line, stock move, quantity, received date, reference, creator, and backup evidence.
- Purchase receipt processing supports partial line receipts, marks orders `partial` until all ordered quantities are received, and computes order/line received, remaining, and receipt-count totals for API/UI consumers.
- Explicit receipt references are idempotent, duplicate line receipt requests are rejected before mutation, over-receipts return a sanitized conflict, and billing remains blocked until the PO is fully received.
- Each partial receipt still creates a canonical stock receipt move into `WH/STOCK`; final receipt completion keeps the same AP bill path through the HayHashvapah vendor-bill engine and period-lock checks.
- The Purchase workspace now shows partial order counts, received `X/Y` progress, a quantity input for the next receivable line, and per-receipt references so operators can receive a PO in multiple warehouse arrivals.
- Tenant backups now include `purchase_receipts`, so restored procurement evidence can reconcile order lines, stock moves, and AP billing history.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js`, `server/db.js`, and `test/purchase.test.js`; `git diff --check` pass; focused purchase regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/purchase.test.js`, 6 pass, 0 fail); broader purchase/API/auditor/sidebar regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/purchase.test.js test/api.test.js test/auditor-readonly-coverage.test.js test/suite-routes.test.mjs test/suite-dashboard-sidebar-openability.test.mjs`, 251 pass, 0 fail); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-purchase-partial-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); browser proof on `http://127.0.0.1:4218/app/purchase` created `UI-PARTIAL-877328`, showed partial `received 2/5`, completed to `received 5/5` through the quantity Receive control, billed the PO, captured `/tmp/a1-suite-purchase-partial-final.png`, and reported no console warnings/errors; full `npm test` pass (702 pass, 0 fail).

### Slice 374 - Purchase Analytics And Vendor 360
- Purchase now exposes tenant-scoped procurement analytics through `GET /api/purchase/analytics`, using the existing purchase reader role contract so Owner/Admin/Operator/Accountant/Auditor can inspect analytics while unsupported roles remain blocked.
- Analytics summarize order count, vendor count, active vendor count, open and billed procurement value, receipt progress, remaining quantity, vendor-priced line coverage, usable active vendor-price count, and active stock-tracked catalog item count.
- Price coverage now counts only currently usable active prices: active vendor, active price row, effective-date window, active stock-tracked catalog item, and tenant match are all required before an item contributes to active price or covered-item metrics.
- Receipt backlog now lists only confirmed or partial purchase orders with remaining quantity, so unconfirmed RFQs do not appear as warehouse receiving work.
- Vendor performance groups orders by linked vendor or manual supplier and reports order count, total/open/billed value, ordered/received/remaining quantities, vendor-priced line count, last order date, and receipt progress.
- The Purchase workspace now renders a `Procurement analytics` / `Vendor 360` panel with receipt progress, price coverage, remaining quantity, active price count, covered item count, top vendor rows, and receipt backlog rows.
- Regression coverage proves analytics RBAC, RFQ exclusion from receipt backlog and receipt progress, suspended/future/expired vendor prices excluded from usable coverage, partial receipt progress, backlog totals, Vendor 360 totals, and covered-item metrics.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/purchase.test.js`; focused purchase regression pass (`node --test test/purchase.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail); broader API/auditor/sidebar regression pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-purchase-analytics-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); browser proof on `http://localhost:4220/app/purchase` created `UI-ANALYTICS-872696`, rendered the visible `Vendor 360` panel with `33% received`, `100%` price coverage, remaining quantity `2`, vendor performance for `Yerevan Hardware Supply`, partial backlog row `UI-ANALYTICS-872696`, and reported no console warnings/errors; full `npm test` pass (703 pass, 0 fail).

### Slice 375 - Purchase Returns To Supplier
- Purchase now persists tenant-scoped `purchase_returns` evidence for unbilled received stock returned to a supplier, including PO, PO line, stock move, quantity, returned date, reference, reason, creator, and backup scope.
- `POST /api/purchase/orders/:id/return` uses the existing purchase-writer role contract and safe metadata/path guards, while keeping finance-operator AP billing separate.
- Supplier returns post canonical inventory moves from `WH/STOCK` to `SUPPLIERS`, reduce net `received_quantity`, update order status back to `partial` or `confirmed`, and keep receipt/return evidence visible on order lines.
- Explicit return references are idempotent even after a full return reopens the order to `confirmed`; conflicting duplicate references, over-returns, unsupported states, and billed-order returns fail before mutation.
- Purchase analytics and Vendor 360 now expose `returnedQuantity`, so returned stock appears in the operating summary and vendor rows instead of only in hidden ledger evidence.
- The Purchase workspace now renders returned quantity in the analytics panel, shows `returned X` on order rows, and exposes a quantity-specific `Return` control beside Receive/Bill for returnable unbilled stock.
- Regression coverage proves partial and full supplier-return flows, stock reversal, idempotent full-return retry after status rollback, over-return guards, billed-return blocking, analytics returned quantity, backup inclusion, RBAC, malformed return metadata, and rollback on failed return insertion.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js`, `server/db.js`, and `test/purchase.test.js`; `git diff --check` pass; focused purchase regression pass (`node --test test/purchase.test.js`, 8 pass, 0 fail); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-purchase-returns-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); browser proof on `http://127.0.0.1:4221/app/purchase` created `UI-RETURN-649393`, rendered the return stock move, `Vendor 360`, `75% received`, `RETURNED QTY 1`, remaining quantity `1`, vendor performance for `Yerevan Hardware Supply`, partial backlog row `UI-RETURN-649393`, and reported no console errors; read-only subagent review approved after the full-return idempotency fix; full `npm test` pass (716 pass, 0 fail).

### Slice 376 - RUB Kopeck S4 App VAT And Money Splitters
- The RUB kopeck migration now covers the app-level VAT and money splitter paths identified as S4 in `docs/RU_KOPECK_MIGRATION_RFC.md`.
- Project billing preview and bill-time convert gross major-unit hourly totals through the active locale money facade before splitting VAT, so RUB invoices store integer kopecks while AMD remains whole-dram identity.
- Workflow-created draft invoices now use the effective VAT rate instead of the stale `/1.2` split, store subtotal/VAT/total as locale minor units, and descale those values before posting to the locale-aware ledger.
- CRM custom quote lines convert submitted major-unit prices to stored minor units, and quote totals split each stored-minor line so `subtotal + vat === total` holds at the kopeck level.
- Purchase explicit unit costs, explicit stock move unit costs, and purchase VAT-on-net calculations now use shared minor-unit helpers, preserving vendor-price/default-cost integer semantics while allowing RUB user-entered kopecks.
- Regression coverage proves RU project billing stores kopecks while trial balance reports rubles, workflow draft invoices store RUB minor units at an effective 22% VAT rate, RU custom quotes keep kopecks per line, and existing catalog/purchase/AMD behavior remains intact.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js`, `test/project-billing.test.js`, and `test/vat-rate-versioning.test.js`; focused project/VAT S4 suite pass (`node --test test/project-billing.test.js test/vat-rate-versioning.test.js`, 11 pass, 0 fail); adjacent catalog/purchase regression pass (`node --test test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js`, 14 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (786 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-kopeck-s4-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 377 - RUB Kopeck S5 App Money Input Validators
- The RUB kopeck migration now covers the app-level input validators identified as S5 in `docs/RU_KOPECK_MIGRATION_RFC.md`.
- A shared locale-aware money parser validates submitted money text/number shapes against the active currency subunit and converts stored app-table money values to integer minor units.
- Finance expense, bill, bill payment, payment receipt, bank import, opening-balance, payroll run/preview, People salary, CRM lead/deal value, collection promise, project hourly billing, catalog price, inventory unit-cost, purchase line, and vendor-price inputs no longer truncate RUB kopecks.
- Payroll and ledger boundaries descale stored minor-unit values back to major units before invoking existing payroll engines or ledger posting helpers, preventing 100x double-scaling while reports continue to display rubles.
- AM behavior remains guarded: zero-subunit integer-only validators still reject fractional money, while legacy AM validators that already rounded fractional major-unit inputs continue to round through the AMD money facade.
- Regression coverage proves RUB finance, operational, CRM/catalog/quote, payroll/People, bank, inventory, purchase, and invalid-overprecision paths store kopecks correctly, and opening-balance malformed AM fractional inputs remain rejected.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js`, `test/kopeck-input-validators.test.js`, and `test/kopeck-s5-app-validators.test.js`; focused S5/opening-balance regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/opening-balances-endpoints.test.js test/kopeck-input-validators.test.js test/kopeck-s5-app-validators.test.js`, 12 pass, 0 fail); broader focused regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/kopeck-s5-app-validators.test.js test/payroll-endpoints.test.js test/catalog.test.js test/payables-endpoints.test.js test/ledger-ru-posting.test.js test/ledger-ru-payroll-contributions.test.js`, 30 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (793 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-kopeck-s5-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 378 - RUB Kopeck S6 Active Currency Defaults
- The RUB kopeck migration now covers active currency defaults identified as S6 in `docs/RU_KOPECK_MIGRATION_RFC.md`.
- Fresh database seeding derives the demo organization's locale and currency from the active locale, so `A1_LOCALE=ru` creates `ru-RU`/`RUB` instead of stale `hy-AM`/`AMD`.
- The 15 reviewed `currency TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'AMD'` schema defaults are now plain required `currency TEXT NOT NULL` columns, forcing seed/runtime callers to provide the tenant currency explicitly.
- Seeded deals, quotes, CRM leads, catalog items, vendor prices, workflow/suite event payloads, and marketing campaigns now use the organization currency instead of hardcoded AMD.
- Runtime inserts and response fallbacks in project billing, CRM lead conversion, quote creation, catalog item creation/update, purchase vendor prices/orders, finance expenses/bills/payments/bank transactions, collection promises, analytics money units, and pilot packets now use the active currency or source-row currency.
- Regression coverage proves fresh RU seed rows are RUB, fresh AM seed rows remain AMD, all reviewed schema currency columns have no SQL default, and omitted-currency runtime inserts inherit RUB across the touched API surfaces.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js`, `server/db.js`, `test/kopeck-s6-active-currency-defaults.test.js`, and patched direct-insert tests; exact hardcoded-AMD scans in `server/app.js` and `server/db.js` return no matches; focused S6/kopeck/catalog/purchase/finance/project/docs regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/kopeck-s6-active-currency-defaults.test.js test/kopeck-input-validators.test.js test/kopeck-s5-app-validators.test.js test/project-billing.test.js test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js test/finance-rbac.test.js test/ledger.test.js test/docs-export.test.js test/docs-sign.test.js test/service-cases-isolation.test.js test/forms-isolation.test.js test/projects.test.js test/people-hr.test.js`, 73 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (796 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-kopeck-s6-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 379 - RUB Kopeck S7 RU Tax Rounding
- The RUB kopeck migration now covers RU tax whole-ruble rounding identified as S7 in `docs/RU_KOPECK_MIGRATION_RFC.md`.
- The vendored RU payroll engine now rounds НДФЛ and employer страховые взносы to whole rubles, including unified and SME contribution paths, instead of letting employer insurance retain kopecks through the storage rounder.
- Payroll gross, net, and employer cost still keep kopecks where the employee salary has kopecks; only the RU tax/contribution amounts use the tax-only whole-ruble rounding contract.
- Suite payroll preview/run APIs continue storing all returned money as integer minor units, so whole-ruble RU tax amounts are represented as kopecks without changing ledger or trial-balance display semantics.
- Regression coverage proves `100000.50 RUB` keeps salary kopecks while employer insurance stores as `3000000` kopecks, verifies the 50-kopeck round-up threshold for НДФЛ and страховые взносы, and checks payroll preview/run ledger rows plus trial-balance reporting for a rounded-up case.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for the RU payroll engine and S7/S5/vendor tests; focused RU payroll/locale/kopeck regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/localization-ru-vendor-wiring.test.js test/locale-money-scale.test.js test/kopeck-s7-ru-tax-rounding.test.js test/kopeck-s5-app-validators.test.js test/payroll-endpoints.test.js test/ledger-ru-payroll-contributions.test.js`, 30 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (799 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-kopeck-s7-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 380 - RUB Kopeck S8 Data Migration And Enablement
- The RUB kopeck migration now covers the final S8 defensive data migration and enablement checkpoint in `docs/RU_KOPECK_MIGRATION_RFC.md`.
- `server/db.js` now creates a `money_precision_migrations` marker table and applies the `rub-kopeck-minor-units-s8` migration exactly once after all seed and repair layers.
- The migration discovers tenant money columns by SQLite schema metadata, records per-table SHA-256 before/after checksums, and reports target columns, currencies, rows checked, and rows scaled.
- AMD remains a checksum-proven no-op: zero-subunit databases keep existing whole-dram integer rows unchanged and record equal before/after checksums.
- Legacy RUB whole-ruble rows scale by `100` into stored kopecks once, and repeated migration calls or database reopens preserve the same values and marker.
- Currency-bearing target rows must match `organizations.currency` before migration, so mixed per-row currency evidence fails before any marker is written.
- Fresh `A1_LOCALE=ru` seeds now finish with RUB demo money stored as kopecks behind the migration marker while AM seeds keep the existing AMD values.
- Regression coverage proves AMD no-op/idempotency, RUB one-time scaling, mixed-currency invariant rejection, and fresh RU seed enablement.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js` and `test/kopeck-s8-data-migration.test.js`; focused S8 migration regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/kopeck-s8-data-migration.test.js`, 4 pass, 0 fail); wider kopeck/accounting regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/kopeck-s8-data-migration.test.js test/kopeck-s6-active-currency-defaults.test.js test/kopeck-s7-ru-tax-rounding.test.js test/kopeck-s5-app-validators.test.js test/kopeck-input-validators.test.js test/project-billing.test.js test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js test/payroll-endpoints.test.js test/ledger-ru-posting.test.js test/ledger-ru-payroll-contributions.test.js test/vat-rate-versioning.test.js`, 57 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; full `npm test` pass (803 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-kopeck-s8-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 381 - Catalog Unit Of Measure Catalog
- Catalog now persists tenant-scoped `catalog_units_of_measure` rows with code, name, kind, precision, status, timestamps, and a tenant/code uniqueness contract.
- Fresh and repaired demo databases seed active `unit`, `package`, `hour`, `kg`, and `liter` units before catalog items are seeded or repaired.
- Existing distinct `catalog_items.unit_of_measure` values are backfilled as active custom UoMs during repair, so tenant-specific legacy unit codes can still be edited after the validator lands.
- Existing `catalog_items.unit_of_measure` remains the stable stored code, so the UoM catalog adds governance without forcing a product-master data migration.
- Catalog category/item APIs now return the UoM catalog alongside categories and items, giving UI consumers a governed source for product-unit choices.
- Catalog item create/update writes reject unknown or inactive unit codes before mutation, preserving the existing category and product metadata guards.
- Tenant backups now include `catalog_units_of_measure`, so restored tenants keep product-unit governance evidence with the product master.
- The Inventory product master now displays the item's unit code beside SKU, name, and category/type, making unit evidence visible to operators.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog/purchase regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js`, 15 pass, 0 fail); full `npm test` pass (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-uom-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 382 - Catalog Variant Spine
- Catalog now persists tenant-scoped `catalog_item_variants` rows linked to parent catalog items, with SKU, name, parsed attributes, unit, price, cost, currency, status, and timestamps.
- Fresh and repaired databases seed scanner and clinic-package variants only when their parent seed item exists, preserving custom tenants that do not carry those demo parent products.
- Variant rows inherit the parent item's unit, list price, standard cost, and currency, so this slice adds SKU-level variant evidence without changing quote, inventory, or purchase parent-item contracts.
- Catalog item list/detail APIs now attach `variants` and `variantCount` to each item, with malformed stored attribute JSON downgraded to an empty object instead of leaking the wrong shape.
- Tenant backups now include `catalog_item_variants`, keeping variant SKU/attribute evidence portable with the product master.
- The Inventory product master now shows total variant count in the overview and per-item variant counts on catalog rows.
- Regression coverage proves seeded variant attachment, parsed attribute JSON, inherited variant pricing, detail endpoint variant visibility, and backup inclusion while existing catalog/purchase flows remain green.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog/purchase regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js`, 15 pass, 0 fail); full `npm test` pass (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled); `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-variant-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 383 - Catalog Margin Evidence
- Catalog item API responses now compute `marginAmount` and `marginPercent` from stored list price and standard cost, keeping margin evidence derived instead of persisting stale duplicate columns.
- Catalog variant API responses carry the same margin evidence, so SKU-level variants inherit the parent item's commercial margin context alongside inherited unit, price, cost, and currency.
- Margin percent is reported as a two-decimal percentage and returns `null` when list price is zero, avoiding divide-by-zero or misleading percentage output.
- The Inventory product master now displays each catalog row's margin percentage beside price while preserving the existing dense product/stock workspace layout.
- Regression coverage proves seeded scanner parent and variant margin evidence while existing catalog/purchase flows remain green.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog/purchase regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js`, 15 pass, 0 fail); broad affected API/service recovery run pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=1 --test-timeout=120000 test/api.test.js test/service-cases.test.js`, 235 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled) after an overloaded full-suite rerun cancelled unrelated long tests; `git diff --check` pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-margin-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 384 - Catalog Sales Pricelist Spine
- Catalog now persists tenant-scoped `catalog_price_lists` rows with code, name, customer segment, currency, status, optional validity windows, and timestamps.
- Catalog price-list item rows link sales prices to parent catalog items and optional catalog variants, carrying minimum quantity, list price, discount-percent placeholder, currency, status, and timestamps.
- Fresh and repaired databases seed an active `STANDARD-SALES` list in the tenant currency, with rows for active catalog items plus variant-level rows for active seeded variants.
- Catalog read payloads now expose `priceLists` beside categories, units, and items, and `/api/catalog/price-lists` provides a dedicated role-gated read endpoint under the existing catalog-reader contract.
- Tenant backups now include `catalog_price_lists` and `catalog_price_list_items`, keeping sales-pricing evidence portable with product master data.
- The Inventory product master overview consumes the catalog payload and shows price-list count beside category, variant, and location evidence.
- Regression coverage proves auth gating, reader-role access, standard pricelist seeding, variant-level price rows, dedicated endpoint parity with bundled catalog payloads, and tenant-backup inclusion while existing catalog/purchase flows remain green.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-sales-pricelist-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); full `npm test` pass (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled).

### Slice 385 - Catalog Sales Discount Evidence
- Catalog price-list item API rows now derive `discountAmount` and `netPrice` from stored `list_price` and `discount_percent`, making discount evidence explicit without persisting duplicate calculated columns.
- Fresh and repaired databases seed a `LOYALTY-10` sales price list beside `STANDARD-SALES`, using the tenant currency and `customer_segment = loyalty`.
- The loyalty list carries 10% discount rows for active parent catalog items and active catalog variants, preserving the same parent/variant pricing evidence shape as the standard list.
- `/api/catalog/items` and `/api/catalog/price-lists` both expose the discounted price-list rows with parent product and variant evidence, while CRM quote pricing, inventory valuation, and purchase flows remain unchanged.
- Tenant backups include the discounted price-list rows through the existing `catalog_price_lists` and `catalog_price_list_items` backup scope.
- The Inventory product master overview now shows both total price-list count and discount-list count beside category, variant, and location evidence.
- Regression coverage proves standard zero-discount evidence, loyalty 10% discount amount/net price derivation, variant-level discount rows, reader-role access, dedicated endpoint parity, and backup inclusion while existing catalog/purchase flows remain green.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog/purchase regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js`, 15 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-sales-discount-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`).

### Slice 386 - Catalog Margin Rule Evidence
- Catalog now persists tenant-scoped `catalog_margin_rules` rows with code, name, scope, minimum margin percent, target margin percent, status, and timestamps.
- Fresh and repaired databases seed active `STOCKABLE-MIN-20` and `SERVICE-MIN-35` item-type margin rules before sales price lists are read.
- Catalog payloads expose `marginRules`, and `/api/catalog/margin-rules` provides a dedicated role-gated read endpoint under the existing catalog-reader contract.
- Sales price-list item API rows now derive net-price margin evidence after discount, including standard cost, margin amount, margin percent, matched rule code, minimum/target margin, and `marginStatus`.
- The seeded `LOYALTY-10` scanner row is flagged `below_minimum` against the stockable 20% rule, while the standard scanner row remains `ok`; CRM quote pricing, inventory valuation, and purchase costing remain unchanged.
- Tenant backups now include `catalog_margin_rules`, keeping margin-governance evidence portable with product master and price-list data.
- The Inventory product master overview now shows margin-rule count and below-minimum margin alert count beside category, variant, price-list, discount-list, and location evidence.
- Regression coverage proves seeded rules, dedicated endpoint parity, reader-role access, standard `ok` margin evidence, loyalty `below_minimum` evidence for parent and variant rows, and backup inclusion while existing catalog/purchase flows remain green.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog/purchase/S8 regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js test/kopeck-s8-data-migration.test.js`, 19 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-margin-rule-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); full `node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=120000` pass (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled).

### Slice 387 - Catalog Price Resolution
- Catalog now exposes `GET /api/catalog/pricing/resolve` as a read-only effective-pricing endpoint under the existing catalog-reader role contract.
- The resolver accepts catalog item, optional variant, customer segment, and quantity query inputs, rejecting malformed IDs, control text, and invalid quantities before lookup.
- Active customer-segment price lists are preferred, while missing segments fall back to the standard sales price list so later quote/POS/portal callers have a deterministic price source.
- Resolved pricing returns the selected price list, item/variant evidence, minimum quantity, list price, discount amount, net price, standard cost, margin-rule evidence, and `marginStatus` in one payload.
- Variant-specific price rows are selected when available, with explicit `variantFallback` evidence reserved for future parent-row fallback cases.
- The resolver keeps CRM quote pricing, inventory valuation, purchase costing, POS, and portal flows unchanged until those modules deliberately consume it.
- Regression coverage proves unauthenticated/support rejection, owner/accountant access, standard and loyalty segment resolution, variant resolution, unknown-segment fallback to `STANDARD-SALES`, malformed query rejection, and unknown-item 404 behavior.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog/purchase/S8 regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js test/kopeck-s8-data-migration.test.js`, 19 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-price-resolution-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); full `node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=120000` pass (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled).

### Slice 388 - Catalog Quote Price Resolution
- CRM quote creation now consumes the catalog price resolver for catalog-backed lines that omit `unitPrice`, turning the read-only resolver into the default quote price source.
- Quote creation derives resolver customer-segment input from the customer profile, so segment price lists such as `LOYALTY-10` can price catalog lines while unmatched segments fall back to `STANDARD-SALES`.
- Explicit quote-line `unitPrice` values remain manual overrides, preserving custom sales quoting behavior for exceptions and negotiated prices.
- Tenant-created active catalog items without price-list rows still fall back to the item list price, preserving existing quote behavior for products added before price-list governance catches up.
- Free-text quote lines, VAT mode handling, inventory valuation, purchase costing, POS, and portal flows remain unchanged.
- Regression coverage proves standard price-list discount resolution, loyalty customer-segment resolution, explicit override preservation, active-item fallback without a price-list row, inactive-item rejection, and existing catalog quote VAT behavior.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog/purchase regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js test/purchase.test.js`, 15 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-quote-price-resolution-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); full `node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=120000` pass (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled).

### Slice 389 - Catalog Quote Variant Lines
- CRM quote lines now persist nullable `catalog_item_variant_id` beside `catalog_item_id`, with startup migration and an index for existing tenant databases.
- Quote line reads expose `catalogItemVariantId`, `variantSku`, and `variantName` through the existing quote formatter, so public quote, workflow, and Customer 360 reads can carry SKU-level evidence without a separate API.
- Quote creation validates that submitted variants are active and belong to the submitted parent catalog item before any quote row is written.
- Variant-backed quote lines pass the variant ID into catalog price resolution, so customer-segment price lists such as `LOYALTY-10` can resolve variant-specific net pricing and default descriptions.
- Malformed variant IDs and parent/variant mismatches are rejected before persistence, while free-text quote lines and explicit quote-line price overrides remain unchanged.
- Inventory valuation, purchase costing, POS, and portal flows remain unchanged until they deliberately consume quote variant evidence.
- Regression coverage proves migration repair for legacy quote-line tables, variant-specific quote pricing, response and stored variant evidence, malformed variant metadata rejection, parent/variant mismatch rejection, and existing catalog quote behavior.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, `test/api.test.js`, and `test/catalog.test.js`; affected API/catalog/S8 regression pass (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=120000 test/api.test.js test/catalog.test.js test/kopeck-s8-data-migration.test.js`, 244 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` pass; `npm run build:ui` pass with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-quote-variants-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` pass (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); full `node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=120000` pass (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled).

### Slice 390 - Catalog Quote Pricing Evidence
- CRM quote lines now persist catalog pricing evidence beside the resolved `unit_price`, including nullable `catalog_price_list_id`, price-list code, pricing source, customer segment, discount amount, and margin status.
- Startup repair adds those quote-line evidence columns plus an `idx_quote_lines_catalog_price_list` index for existing tenant databases, preserving legacy manual quote-line behavior.
- Quote line reads expose `pricingSource`, `catalogPriceListId`, `catalogPriceListCode`, `pricingCustomerSegment`, `discountAmount`, and `marginStatus` through the existing quote formatter, so public quote, workflow, and Customer 360 reads carry pricing provenance without a separate API.
- Catalog-resolved lines now store price-list evidence for `STANDARD-SALES` and `LOYALTY-10`, while tenant-created active catalog items without price-list rows are marked as catalog-item fallback evidence.
- Explicit quote-line unit-price overrides remain manual pricing with blank price-list evidence and zero discount, preserving negotiated quote behavior.
- Free-text quote lines, VAT mode handling, inventory valuation, purchase costing, POS, and portal flows remain unchanged until they deliberately consume pricing provenance.
- Regression coverage proves migration repair for legacy quote-line tables, standard and loyalty price-list evidence, discount and margin-status evidence, variant-line stored evidence, explicit manual override evidence, and existing catalog quote behavior.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, `test/api.test.js`, and `test/catalog.test.js`; focused catalog regression passes (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 test/catalog.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail); focused migration regression passes (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 --test-name-pattern="existing quote line tables receive catalog columns" test/api.test.js`, 1 pass, 0 fail); affected API/catalog/S8 regression passes (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=120000 test/api.test.js test/catalog.test.js test/kopeck-s8-data-migration.test.js`, 244 pass, 0 fail); `git diff --check` passes; `npm run build:ui` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-quote-pricing-evidence-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); full `node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=120000` passes (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled).

### Slice 391 - Catalog Quote Pricing Evidence UI
- CRM quote rows now render a compact summary plus catalog pricing evidence chips for quote lines that carry pricing provenance.
- Evidence chips identify the selected SKU/name and show price-list code or pricing source, customer segment, quantity x unit price, discount amount, and margin status from the existing quote-line fields.
- Below-minimum margin lines use warning styling, visible evidence is capped to the first three lines, and additional evidence is summarized with a `+N lines` marker.
- Responsive chip wrapping prevents long SKU, price-list, discount, and margin evidence from overflowing the CRM Quotes panel on mobile.
- This is a UI-only slice: quote APIs, resolver behavior, explicit manual overrides, free-text quote lines, finance draft-invoice creation, inventory valuation, purchase costing, POS, and portal flows remain unchanged.
- Verification for the checkpoint: `git diff --check` passes; `npm run build:ui` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk warning; browser proof on a catalog-backed quote shows `STANDARD-SALES`, `HW-BARCODE-SCANNER-USB`, `standard`, and `margin ok` in CRM on desktop `1280x720` and mobile `390x844` with no mobile overflow; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-catalog-quote-pricing-evidence-ui-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=12, kpis=4`); full `node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=120000` passes (804 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled).

### Slice 392 - Catalog Quantity-Break Pricing Evidence
- Catalog sales price-list seeding now adds active `STANDARD-SALES` quantity-break rows for the POS barcode scanner parent and variants at `min_quantity = 5`.
- The break rows reuse the existing price-list item contract with 5% `discount_percent`, derived `discountAmount`, `netPrice`, margin rule evidence, and backup portability.
- The existing catalog pricing resolver now has seeded data that proves highest-eligible `minQuantity` selection: quantity-5 scanner pricing resolves to `80,750 AMD` net with `4,250 AMD` per-unit discount and `marginStatus = ok`.
- CRM quote creation consumes the same resolver result for catalog-backed quantity-5 quote lines, preserving the `STANDARD-SALES` price-list evidence and storing the per-unit break discount on the quote line.
- The Inventory overview now shows the count of quantity-break rows beside price-list, discount-list, margin-rule, and margin-alert evidence.
- Quote APIs, explicit manual overrides, loyalty pricing, free-text quote lines, finance draft-invoice creation, inventory valuation, purchase costing, POS, and portal flows remain otherwise unchanged.

### Slice 393 - Catalog Category Margin-Rule Evidence
- Catalog margin governance now matches category-scoped rules before item-type fallback rules, using the existing `catalog_margin_rules.scope_type` and `scope_value` contract.
- Fresh and repaired tenant databases seed active `HARDWARE-MIN-25` for the POS and device hardware category while preserving `STOCKABLE-MIN-20` and `SERVICE-MIN-35` as item-type defaults.
- Price-list item API rows now carry `categoryId` and `categoryName` evidence alongside SKU, variant, discount, and margin fields.
- Scanner price-list rows now use the category-specific `HARDWARE-MIN-25` rule; the quantity-5 scanner break remains `80,750 AMD` net with `4,250 AMD` per-unit discount but is flagged `below_minimum` against the 25% category minimum.
- CRM quote creation consumes the same stricter margin status for catalog-backed quantity-5 quote lines, preserving price-list and discount evidence.
- The Inventory overview now shows category-rule count beside price-list, discount-list, quantity-break, margin-rule, and margin-alert evidence.

### Slice 394 - Catalog Quote Margin-Rule Evidence
- CRM quote lines now persist the matched catalog margin-rule provenance beside the existing price-list, discount, and margin-status evidence.
- Startup repair adds `margin_rule_code`, `margin_rule_minimum_percent`, and `margin_rule_target_percent` to existing `quote_lines` tables before quote-line indexes are used.
- Catalog-resolved quote lines expose `marginRuleCode`, `marginRuleMinimumPercent`, and `marginRuleTargetPercent` through the existing quote formatter for CRM, public quote, workflow, and Customer 360 reads.
- Service quote lines carry `SERVICE-MIN-35`, scanner quote lines carry `HARDWARE-MIN-25`, and catalog-backed quantity-5 scanner quotes keep the `below_minimum` status with its 25% minimum evidence.
- Explicit manual unit-price overrides and free-text quote lines keep blank/null margin-rule evidence, preserving negotiated quote behavior.
- CRM quote evidence chips now show the matched rule code and minimum percent, so operators see which rule produced a below-minimum warning.

### Slice 395 - Project Profitability Evidence
- Projects now expose `GET /api/projects/:id/profitability` beside billing preview and bill-time, using the existing project path/query guards and tenant-scoped time-entry evidence.
- The endpoint separates billed and unbilled minutes/entry counts, estimates unbilled revenue with the same hourly-rate and VAT-as-of semantics as billing preview, and reports invoice-backed billed revenue without creating new finance state.
- Profitability responses include project/customer/currency context, billed/unbilled/total revenue, conservative `costTotal = 0`, gross profit, gross margin percent, invoice count, and invoice evidence for billed project time.
- The Projects modern Billing view now fetches the profitability envelope, shows billed revenue, unbilled estimate, gross profit, gross margin, and invoice evidence above the existing billing preview.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks project-level profitability evidence as present while leaving task/product cost-basis profitability as a remaining depth gap.

### Slice 396 - Project Task Dependency Evidence
- Projects now persist task dependencies in `project_task_dependencies`, keyed by organization, project, blocked task, and dependency task with a unique tuple and lookup indexes.
- Task dependency routes let project writers add `POST /api/projects/:id/tasks/:taskId/dependencies` and remove `DELETE /api/projects/:id/tasks/:taskId/dependencies/:dependsOnTaskId` links without creating duplicate edges.
- Dependency writes validate project/task ownership, reject malformed route/body IDs before side effects, block self-dependencies, and prevent dependency cycles.
- `GET /api/projects/:id` now serializes each task with `blockedBy` and `blocking` evidence arrays, plus stable dependency ID arrays for downstream callers.
- The modern Projects workspace and project detail task tables now show compact `Blocked by` evidence, and the API schema accepts dependency task references.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks task dependency evidence as present while leaving templates, subtasks, recurring tasks, field-service depth, and task/product cost-basis profitability as remaining project-depth gaps.

- Service SLA APIs expose `GET /api/service/sla-policies` and supervisor-gated `POST /api/service/sla-policies`; writes upsert the priority/channel scope, validate safe response/resolution windows, preserve tenant isolation, and audit policy changes.
- New service cases now calculate `slaDueAt` from the best active priority/channel SLA policy, falling back to the prior high-priority four-hour and standard twenty-four-hour behavior when no policy exists.
- `/api/service/console` now serializes `slaPolicies` beside case queue, workflow, customer, and agent evidence, and tenant backups include the SLA policy table.
- The modern Desk workspace now renders a read-only `SLA Policies` evidence panel with policy count, active count, priority/channel scope, response target, resolution target, and active status through the API schema.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks SLA policy evidence and visibility as present while leaving SLA policy editing UX, field-service planning, worksheets, dispatch/mobile flows, and task/product cost-basis profitability as remaining service/project-depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, and `test/service-cases.test.js`; focused Service Desk backend regression passes (`node --test test/service-cases.test.js`, 6 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts`, 54 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1477 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2535 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-service-sla-policies-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 401 - Service SLA Policy Editing UX
- The modern Desk `SLA Policies` panel now includes a compact policy editor for supervisors to upsert policy name, priority, channel scope, response minutes, resolution minutes, and active state through the existing `POST /api/service/sla-policies` route.
- Saving a policy refreshes both the service console envelope and standalone SLA policy query so the table evidence updates without leaving the Desk workspace.
- Blank-channel policies now render as `Any channel`, matching the editor option and making default priority policies legible.
- This is a frontend UX slice over the Slice 400 backend contract; service case SLA calculation, tenant isolation, audit, and API validation remain unchanged.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks SLA policy editing UX as present while leaving field-service planning, worksheets, dispatch/mobile flows, and task/product cost-basis profitability as remaining service/project-depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: focused modern schema regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts`, 54 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1477 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2535 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-service-sla-editor-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 402 - Service Field Visit Planning Evidence
- Service Desk now persists organization-scoped field visits in `service_field_visits`, with fresh-schema constraints, lookup indexes, startup repair for existing databases, backup-table inclusion, and seeded demo visit evidence.
- Field visit APIs expose `GET /api/service/field-visits`, supervisor-gated `POST /api/service/field-visits`, and supervisor-gated `PATCH /api/service/field-visits/:id`; writes validate case/customer/user ownership, safe timestamps, status, location, worksheet summary, route IDs, tenant isolation, and audit create/update events.
- `/api/service/console` now serializes `fieldVisits` beside case queue, SLA policies, workflow, customer, and agent evidence so Desk can render service appointment planning without an extra fetch when the console envelope is current.
- The modern Desk workspace now renders a read-only `Field Visits` evidence panel with visit count, scheduled/completed totals, case/customer, assignee, scheduled window, location, status, and worksheet summary through the API schema.
- The API schema accepts nullable assignees for imported or repaired visit evidence while rendering unassigned visits cleanly in the Desk panel.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks field service visit planning and worksheet evidence as present while leaving dispatch/mobile technician flows and task/product cost-basis profitability as remaining service/project-depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/db.js`, `server/app.js`, and `test/service-cases.test.js`; focused Service Desk backend regression passes (`node --test test/service-cases.test.js`, 11 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts`, 57 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1482 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2538 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-service-field-visits-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 403 - Service Technician Visit Workflow
- Service Desk now exposes `GET /api/service/my-field-visits` so desk users can retrieve only the field visits assigned to their user inside the current tenant.
- Assigned technicians can advance their own visits through the governed `en-route -> in-progress -> completed` workflow via `POST /api/service/field-visits/:id/technician-status` without needing supervisor privileges.
- Technician status writes preserve supervisor override through the existing supervisor PATCH route, reject malformed route/body metadata before side effects, prevent skipped status transitions, preserve tenant isolation, and audit `service.field_visit.technician_status` with visit, case, customer, actor, status, and worksheet-change evidence.
- The modern Desk workspace now renders a compact `My Visits` panel beside the field-visit evidence panel, with assigned/active totals, case/customer, scheduled window, location, worksheet summary editing, and action buttons for en-route, start, and complete.
- The API schema now includes the technician status POST contract while keeping the field-visit wire status open for future server-side states.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks assigned-technician visit workflow as present while leaving dedicated mobile/offline dispatch tooling and task/product cost-basis profitability as remaining service/project-depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/service-cases.test.js`; focused Service Desk backend regression passes (`node --test test/service-cases.test.js`, 15 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts`, 60 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1486 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2541 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-technician-field-visits-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 404 - Project Task/Product Cost-Basis Profitability
- `GET /api/projects/:id/profitability` now accepts an optional `costRate` query beside `hourlyRate` and `asOf`, validates it through the existing safe project billing metadata guard, and reports `laborCostTotal`, `productCostTotal`, and combined `costTotal`.
- The profitability endpoint now returns `taskProfitability` rows for task-linked and unassigned time entries, including billed/open minutes, entry count, revenue estimate, labor cost, gross profit, and margin percent.
- Projects linked to CRM deals now surface `productCostEvidence` from catalog-backed quote lines in sent/viewed/accepted quotes, preferring variant standard cost when present and excluding draft quote lines from profitability evidence.
- The modern Projects Billing view now renders cost rate, labor cost, product cost, task cost-basis rows, product quote cost evidence, and the existing invoice evidence in one compact profitability panel.
- The API schema accepts both the new cost-basis envelope and legacy profitability payloads without task/product evidence, preserving compatibility for older fixture or integration data.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks task/product cost-basis profitability evidence as present while leaving dedicated mobile/offline dispatch tooling and deeper accounting-grade cost allocation as remaining service/project-depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/project-billing.test.js`; focused project billing regression passes (`node --test test/project-billing.test.js`, 10 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema/Projects route regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts src/routes/app/projects/-index.test.tsx`, 104 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1487 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2543 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-project-cost-basis-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 405 - Offline-Safe Technician Dispatch Queue
- Technician visit status updates now accept an optional safe `idempotencyKey`, record compact dispatch replay evidence in the existing audit stream, and return `idempotent` plus `dispatchSync` metadata when offline clients replay an already-applied action.
- Replayed technician dispatch actions with the same visit, actor, status, worksheet intent, and idempotency key return 200 without a second audit row or transition error; reused keys with different status or worksheet intent are rejected safely before mutation.
- The Desk `My Visits` panel now sends technician status actions with idempotency keys, stores failed network/offline updates in a bounded localStorage queue, shows compact pending/queued evidence, and exposes a `Sync now` replay control.
- The offline queue tolerates corrupt localStorage by resetting to an empty queue and replays actions sequentially, removing successful/idempotent updates while preserving failed updates for a later sync.
- The API schema now accepts technician status response replay metadata while preserving the prior no-key `{ ok, visit }` response shape.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks offline-safe technician dispatch queue and idempotent replay evidence as present while leaving a dedicated mobile/PWA dispatch shell with maps/navigation as the next field-service depth gap.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/service-cases.test.js`; focused Service Desk backend regression passes (`node --test test/service-cases.test.js`, 16 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema/Desk route regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts src/routes/app/desk/-index.test.tsx`, 68 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1488 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2549 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-offline-dispatch-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 406 - Technician Dispatch Shell
- Service field visit payloads now include deterministic `dispatchNavigation` evidence with sanitized address, map query, Google Maps search URL, Google Maps directions URL, provider, and source fields derived from location/customer/case data without network calls or schema migration.
- The modern Desk workspace now links from `My Visits` into `/app/desk/dispatch`, a mobile-first technician route board with assigned/active/pending counts, active-or-next visit focus, assigned route list, status chips, worksheet evidence, scheduled windows, location lines, and external map/navigation controls.
- The dispatch shell reuses the offline-safe technician status queue and idempotency replay contract, so en-route/start/complete actions share the same bounded localStorage queue, corrupt-storage reset, pending evidence, and `Sync now` replay behavior as the Desk panel.
- The API schema now accepts the backend navigation envelope while staying open to future mobile providers, and the TanStack route tree includes the generated `/app/desk/dispatch` route.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks the dedicated mobile/PWA dispatch shell with maps/navigation as present while leaving GPS/geolocation capture, native offline map tiles, push-style dispatch alerts, route optimization, and deeper accounting-grade cost allocation as remaining field-service depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/service-cases.test.js`; focused Service Desk backend regression passes (`node --test test/service-cases.test.js`, 16 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema/Desk route regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts src/routes/app/desk/-dispatch.test.tsx src/routes/app/desk/-index.test.tsx`, 74 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1488 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2555 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-dispatch-shell-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 407 - Technician GPS Capture Evidence
- Service Desk now exposes `POST /api/service/field-visits/:id/technician-location` so assigned technicians and service supervisors can capture bounded GPS/geolocation evidence for a tenant field visit.
- Technician location capture validates latitude, longitude, accuracy, capture timestamp, source, and idempotency key before side effects, records durable `service.field_visit.technician_location` audit evidence, and returns latest `technicianLocation` evidence on field-visit read/status/location responses.
- Location captures are replay-safe when an idempotency key is provided: identical evidence returns `idempotent` plus `locationSync` metadata, while key reuse for different coordinates is rejected without adding audit rows or echoing secrets.
- The mobile dispatch shell now includes a compact `Capture GPS` control, browser geolocation capture, pending/locked/error states, latest GPS coordinate and accuracy evidence, captured time, and HTTPS map links with a Google Maps coordinate fallback.
- The API schema now accepts technician GPS evidence and the location capture request/response envelope while preserving prior field-visit compatibility.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks GPS/geolocation capture evidence as present while leaving native offline map tiles, push-style dispatch alerts, route optimization, and deeper accounting-grade cost allocation as remaining field-service depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/service-cases.test.js`; focused Service Desk backend regression passes (`node --test test/service-cases.test.js`, 19 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema/Desk route regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts src/routes/app/desk/-dispatch.test.tsx src/routes/app/desk/-index.test.tsx`, 82 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1491 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2563 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-technician-gps-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 408 - Dispatch Alert Feed and Browser Notifications
- Service Desk now exposes `GET /api/service/my-dispatch-alerts` for assigned technicians plus `POST /api/service/dispatch-alerts/:id/ack` for audit-backed alert acknowledgement.
- Dispatch alerts are derived from active assigned visits, including active route, due-soon, missing-GPS, and overdue-window evidence, and they stay tenant/user scoped through the existing Desk access gate.
- Alert IDs include a short SHA-256-derived dedupe version, so stale browser IDs cannot acknowledge a newer rescheduled alert instance; malformed and whitespace-wrapped path IDs are rejected before audit side effects.
- The mobile dispatch shell now renders a compact dispatch-alert panel, notification-trigger controls backed by the browser Notification API, stable dedupe-key notification tags, acknowledgement failure states, and dedupe-key local persistence for offline-tolerant hiding.
- Status and GPS capture success now invalidate the alert feed so due-soon, active-route, and GPS-missing evidence refreshes when the underlying visit state changes.
- The API schema accepts the dispatch alert feed and strict acknowledgement response contract while preserving passthrough compatibility for future alert metadata.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks browser dispatch alert feed and acknowledgement evidence as present while leaving native/service-worker push alerts, native offline map tiles, route optimization, and deeper accounting-grade cost allocation as remaining field-service depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/service-cases.test.js`; focused Service Desk dispatch-alert regression passes (`node --test --test-name-pattern "dispatch alert|dispatch gps" test/service-cases.test.js`, 7 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema/Desk route regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts src/routes/app/desk/-dispatch.test.tsx src/routes/app/desk/-index.test.tsx`, 93 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1498 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2574 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-dispatch-alerts-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 409 - Field-Service Route Optimization Evidence
- Field visit list responses now enrich active assigned visits with deterministic `dispatchNavigation.routeOptimization` evidence, grouped by technician and ordered by scheduled service window.
- Route optimization evidence stays honest and local-first: `scheduled-window-order-v1`, `fallback`, `local-schedule`, stop number, stop total, reference timestamp, location source, and `distance-matrix-not-run` limitations are returned without claiming live traffic or distance-matrix optimization.
- Terminal visits are excluded from route stop totals, and assigned-user and tenant scoping remain inherited from the existing `GET /api/service/field-visits`, `GET /api/service/my-field-visits`, and service console read paths.
- The mobile dispatch shell now shows a compact `Route plan` chip under each route line, including stop order, strategy, optional ETA/distance/savings evidence, and it preserves the existing map/navigation link behavior.
- The API schema now accepts route optimization evidence under `dispatchNavigation` with bounded numeric validation and passthrough compatibility for future provider-specific evidence.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks schedule/location route-plan evidence as present while leaving native offline map tiles, native/service-worker push alerts, live distance-matrix/traffic-aware route optimization, and deeper accounting-grade cost allocation as remaining field-service depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax checks pass for `server/app.js` and `test/service-cases.test.js`; focused Service Desk route/field-visit regression passes (`node --test --test-name-pattern "route optimization|field visit" test/service-cases.test.js`, 8 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema/Desk route regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts src/routes/app/desk/-dispatch.test.tsx src/routes/app/desk/-index.test.tsx`, 96 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test`, 1500 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2577 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-route-optimization-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 410 - Local PWA Dispatch Notification Readiness
- The modern dispatch shell now ships a local `manifest.webmanifest`, app icon, and root-scoped dispatch service worker asset so the technician route can participate in installable PWA notification flows.
- The SPA bootstrap registers `/a1-dispatch-sw.js` in service-worker-capable secure contexts while cleanly reporting unsupported or insecure contexts without blocking app startup.
- The dispatch alert `Notify` action now requests the browser notification permission, posts alert title/body/tag evidence to the ready service worker when available, and falls back to direct `new Notification(...)` delivery when the worker is unavailable.
- The dispatch service worker accepts only the bounded `A1_DISPATCH_ALERT_NOTIFY` message shape, normalizes notification title/options, displays the alert through `registration.showNotification`, and focuses or opens `/app/desk/dispatch` when a technician taps the notification.
- This slice is local readiness only: it does not add VAPID keys, provider push subscriptions, server-side push queues, or background polling when the PWA is closed.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks local service-worker dispatch notification readiness as present while leaving externally triggered background push dispatch alerts, native offline map tiles, live distance-matrix/traffic-aware route optimization, and deeper accounting-grade cost allocation as remaining field-service depth gaps.
- Verification for the checkpoint: service worker syntax and manifest JSON checks pass (`node --check web-modern/public/a1-dispatch-sw.js`; JSON parse of `web-modern/public/manifest.webmanifest`); focused modern PWA/Desk regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/pwa/dispatch-service-worker.test.ts src/routes/app/desk/-dispatch.test.tsx src/routes/app/desk/-index.test.tsx`, 26 pass, 0 fail); focused backend Service Desk regression passes (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 --test-name-pattern="dispatch alert|technician location|technician field visit routes|technician status|field visit|route optimization" test/service-cases.test.js`, 19 pass, 0 fail); full backend test suite passes (`npm test -- --test-name-pattern "dispatch alert|dispatch gps|route optimization|field visit"`, 1500 pass, 0 fail; runner executed the full suite); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2582 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `git diff --check` passes; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-pwa-dispatch-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).

### Slice 411 - Field-Service Cost Allocation Evidence
- Field visit read paths now include a deterministic `costAllocation` evidence envelope for every service field visit, using the scheduled visit window as the first local cost-basis signal.
- The envelope is deliberately accounting-honest: labor, travel, material, and total cost default to zero until rates, travel policies, and inventory consumption links are configured; ledger mapping evidence points to RA management/cost accounts (`8112`, `7113`, `713`) with `not-posted` statuses.
- Cost allocation evidence is returned through `GET /api/service/field-visits`, `GET /api/service/my-field-visits`, and service console `fieldVisits`, preserving existing tenant and assigned-user scoping.
- The mobile dispatch shell now shows a compact `Cost basis` chip under each route line, including scheduled/labor minutes, current total cost, and not-posted status without exposing raw ledger payloads on the technician card.
- The API schema validates the cost allocation envelope with bounded minutes, bounded cost amounts, and bounded ledger/limitation arrays while preserving passthrough compatibility for future posted-cost evidence.
- The ERP comparison plan now marks field-service cost allocation evidence as present while leaving posted accounting-grade allocation across payroll, inventory consumption, procurement, and ledger journals as the remaining depth gap.
- Verification for the checkpoint: syntax check passes for `server/app.js`; focused backend Service Desk regression passes (`node --test --test-concurrency=4 --test-timeout=60000 --test-name-pattern="cost allocation|field visit|route optimization|technician status|technician location|dispatch alert" test/service-cases.test.js`, 19 pass, 0 fail); focused modern schema/Desk regression passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test -- src/lib/api/schemas.test.ts src/routes/app/desk/-dispatch.test.tsx src/routes/app/desk/-index.test.tsx`, 99 pass, 0 fail); full modern web test suite passes (`npm --prefix web-modern run test`, 2584 pass, 0 fail); `npm --prefix web-modern run typecheck` passes; `npm --prefix web-modern run build` passes with the existing Vite large-chunk and Node `module.register()` deprecation warnings; `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB=/tmp/a1-suite-field-service-cost-smoke.sqlite ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=0 npm run smoke` passes (`smoke ok: Armosphera Demo Clinic, apps=15, kpis=4`).
