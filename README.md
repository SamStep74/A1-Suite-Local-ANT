# A1 Suite

> Part of the **A1** product family. Brand mark: deep-teal `#1E3A3A` rounded square with white **A1**, product name beside it.

Sovereign, self-hostable Armenian business operating system with phased one-to-one
Zoho One functional parity. Runs entirely on your own server: data and database stay
local, and outbound network is off by default. The Copilot uses local deterministic
guidance unless OpenRouter and any Open Notebook source are explicitly configured
and allowed through the same deny-until-listed egress gate.

Built by evolving the Armosphera-One prototype; folds in HayHashvapah Finance
(incl. RA-law RAG) and Armosphera CRM assets over the roadmap. See the design spec at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-armosphera-one-claude-local-design.md`.

Operator installation, backup, and tenant transfer procedures are documented in
`docs/deployment/a1-suite-installation-transfer-trilingual.md`.

## Run (local server)

```bash
npm install
npm run build:ui
npm start
```

For phone/lab LAN access (OPPO / remote preview), start with LAN binding:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=4178 npm run start:lan
```

Default URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4100`. The SQLite database is created outside this
folder, under the OS application-support directory (e.g.
`~/Library/Application Support/ArmospheraOneClaude/armosphera-one.db` on macOS), so it
is never placed in a synced folder.

Demo owner:
- Email: `owner@armosphera.local`
- Password: `change-me-now`

## Data sovereignty

- Outbound network is OFF by default. To allow specific outbound calls (e.g. opt-in
  webhooks or cloud AI), set `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS=1` and list hosts in
  `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST` (comma-separated). Loopback is always allowed.
- The AI core is wired through the vendored `@a1/ai` package. OpenRouter is the
  single opt-in cloud provider for the live model menu, and Open Notebook can be
  enabled as an advisory supplemental source beside the local RA-law RAG. With no
  key configured or egress disabled, the model menu falls back to bundled entries
  and Copilot responses stay offline-deterministic. See `docs/AI.md`.

## Karpathy evals

Focused product-research evals live under `evals/karpathy/` and run through the
shared `@a1/ai` runner declared in `package.json`:

```bash
npm run karpathy:list
npm run karpathy:program -- egress-policy-contract
npm run karpathy:run -- egress-policy-contract
```

The `egress-policy-contract` lane locks the local-first sovereignty boundary:
outbound network stays off by default, external hosts are deny-until-listed,
OpenRouter and Open Notebook adapters use the same injected egress gate, and
loopback/local model defaults remain available for self-hosted deployments.

## Armenian localization & fiscal engines

The Republic-of-Armenia fiscal logic — ՀՎՀՀ + AMD money, the 11 marzer + phone
formats, the 623-account chart of accounts, SRC e-invoice XML, the VAT return
(decree N 298-Ն), and 2026 payroll — is owned by the standalone package
**[a1-localization-am](https://github.com/SamStep74/A1-Localization-AM)** (the single
source of truth, shared with HayHashvapah and future A1 products — sibling to the
`a1-ai` extraction).

Suite **vendors** a verbatim copy under `server/vendor/a1-localization-am/` (pinned
commit in its `VENDOR.md`); the `server/<engine>.js` files are thin re-export shims and
the HTTP surface is mounted by `server/localizationRoutes.js`. Fix bugs upstream in the
package, then re-vendor — see [`docs/LOCALIZATION_API.md`](docs/LOCALIZATION_API.md).

## Legal knowledge base (RA-law RAG)

Armenian-law retrieval is local and offline-first. Lexical search (BM25) needs no
model and no network. Optional semantic re-ranking uses a local Ollama embedder
(`bge-m3`) over loopback; if it is absent, search falls back to BM25 automatically.

Install the prebuilt knowledge base:

```bash
node scripts/install-laws.js [path-to-laws.sqlite]
```

With no argument it looks for an existing HayHashvapah build at
`~/Library/Application Support/HayHashvapahWebClaude/data/laws.sqlite`. The KB is
copied to `~/Library/Application Support/ArmospheraOneClaude/laws.sqlite` (override
with `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_LAWS_DB`). Query it via `GET /api/legal/law-search?q=...`.

### Build the KB from raw law sources (in-repo, dependency-lean)

A1 Suite can build the knowledge base directly from local legislation files with
no network access. Put one law per `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf` file in a directory
(the filename becomes the law title), then:

```bash
node scripts/ingest-laws.js <source-dir> [dest.sqlite]          # BM25-only (offline default)
node scripts/ingest-laws.js <source-dir> [dest.sqlite] --embed  # + local vector embeddings
```

The ingest splits each source into article-aware chunks on `Հոդված N` / `Article N`
markers (the article number is captured for precise retrieval), writes the canonical
`law_chunks` table, and is idempotent (content-hashed chunk ids — re-running only fills
gaps). With no `dest`, it writes to `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_LAWS_DB` / the default data dir.

`--embed` is **opt-in and failure-tolerant**: it calls the local Ollama embedder
(`bge-m3`) over loopback to populate vectors for hybrid search. If the embedder is not
running, the rows stay lexical (BM25) and the command still succeeds — the KB is never
left in a broken state.

> **PDF sources:** `.pdf` files are accepted directly when the local `pdftotext`
> binary is available. If it is missing, PDFs are skipped with a warning while
> `.txt` / `.md` sources still ingest normally; install Poppler or pre-convert PDFs
> to text on hosts where native extraction is not available.

## Configuration

| Env var | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP port | `4100` |
| `HOST` | Bind address (keep loopback for local-only access) | `127.0.0.1` |
| `A1_STUDIO_DATA_DIR` | Platform alias for data directory override | OS app-support dir |
| `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DATA_DIR` | Legacy data directory override | OS app-support dir |
| `A1_STUDIO_SQLITE` | Platform alias for DB file path | `/opt/a1/product-data/studio/armosphera-one.db` |
| `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_DB` | Legacy DB file path override | `<data dir>/armosphera-one.db` |
| `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_ALLOW_EGRESS` | `1` to permit outbound calls | off |
| `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST` | Allowed outbound hosts (comma-separated) | empty |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Optional OpenRouter key for the egress-gated live model menu and Copilot policy | empty |
| `A1_MODEL_DEFAULT` / `A1_MODEL_COPILOT` / `A1_MODEL_FINANCE` / `A1_MODEL_CRM` / `A1_MODEL_DOCS` | Optional per-aspect model policy overrides; empty means auto/live-menu selection | empty |
| `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENABLED` | `1` to include Open Notebook hits as advisory supplemental Copilot sources | off |
| `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_BASE_URL` | Open Notebook endpoint, allowed only when egress policy permits that host | empty |
| `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_API_KEY` | Optional Open Notebook API key, stored/redacted like other AI secrets | empty |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | Local-first legacy provider hint retained for compatibility; Copilot cloud provider is OpenRouter | `local` |
| `LOCAL_AI_BASE_URL` | Local AI endpoint (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible) retained for local-first compatibility | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` |
| `LOCAL_AI_MODEL` | Local AI model retained for local-first compatibility | `gemma3:4b` |
| `ARMOSPHERA_ONE_LAWS_DB` | Override the legal KB path | `<data dir>/laws.sqlite` |
| `LAW_EMBED_MODEL` | Local embedder model for semantic search | `bge-m3` |
| `LAW_EMBED_BASE` | Local embedder base URL (loopback) | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` |
| `A1_PLATFORM_TENANT_RESOLUTION` | `1` to resolve Studio tenant context from A1 Platform | off |
| `A1_PLATFORM_API_URL` | A1 Platform API base URL through VM gateway/tunnel | `http://127.0.0.1:8088` |
| `A1_PLATFORM_TOKEN` | Optional server-to-server token for sensitive tenant context | empty |
| `A1_PLATFORM_TENANT_STRICT` | `1` to fail closed when platform lookup is unavailable or host is unknown | off |
| `A1_PLATFORM_TENANT_TIMEOUT_MS` | Platform tenant lookup timeout | `1200` |
| `A1_PLATFORM_TENANT_CACHE_MS` | Per-host tenant lookup cache TTL | `10000` |

When tenant resolution is enabled, Studio asks A1 Platform for the current
tenant by `product=studio` and forwards the original request host in
`x-a1-request-host`. Non-strict mode fails open for temporary platform lookup
errors; strict mode fails closed. Tenant maintenance, tenant disabled, module
disabled, and egress-blocked responses always block the request. Public health
responses expose only enabled/resolved/strict flags; the authenticated
audit-reader tenant summary redacts database URLs and only exposes sanitized
module codes.

For the supported VM runtime, keep A1 Platform inside the Ubuntu VM and expose it
to Mac-hosted product dev servers through `infra/vm/a1-vm.sh tunnel`; then use
`A1_PLATFORM_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8088`. Do not require Docker Desktop on the
Mac or client machine.
